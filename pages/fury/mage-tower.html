                <p><a class="h3-link text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHlc1fCbEUQ">Video</a></p>
                <p>Although I had a series of sub 10% wipes, I got pretty lucky with the timing of her abilities on the kill, so although the fight is mostly scripted, there <em>is</em> an element of RNG and some variance within her phases. If you feel as though you're doing everything correctly, but just getting stomped by certain combinations during the fight, I suggest trying to push her phases at different times.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>The fight is about control; while the high DPS requirement makes it feel like a DPS race, it's actually a survivability one. You're better off saving cooldowns to deal with her adds (Umbral/Scorching Imps), rather than trying to simply burn her health down quickly. There's no enrage, so if you handle the adds well, you'll take less damage, and can keep the fight going as long as need be. I didn't even realize I killed her on my kill, being so focused on dodging mechanics, her defeat took me completely by surprise.</p></li>
                <li><p>Drums reset with each attempt now, though I still found them better to use during the latter portion of the fight - if you can't make it through Phase 1, you're not going to make it through Phase 2 anyway.</p></li>
                <li><p>Kiting the Fuming Imps with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=12323/piercing-howl">Piercing Howl</a> is a valid strategy, though I found it more difficult due to losing GCDs, and often requiring me to kite away from the adds I was trying to kill. Ideally, you'll stack all of the Fuming Imps void zones atop one another to the side or under the boss.</p></li>
                <li><p><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6552/pummel">Pummel</a> will sometimes not interrupt her channel, even if her shield is down. I haven't looked into the cause, though I believe I only ever saw it happen during phase 1.</p></li>
                <li><p>I'd recommend at least 900 ilvl equipped. It can certainly be accomplished with lower, but it will be increasingly more difficult to meet the damage and survivability checks.</p></li>
                <li><p><a class="text-link" href="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/fury/c85M">Talents</a> - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave">Shockwave</a>/<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=215569/wrecking-ball">Wrecking Ball</a>/<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=208154/warpaint">Warpaint</a> are alternatives, but I found that the adds were rarely grouped well enough to stun more than one or two at a time, and focusing on killing extra targets within cooldown windows emphasized the use of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=100130/furious-slash">Furious Slash</a> (with T19 4p tier) rather than <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=215569/wrecking-ball">Wrecking Ball</a>-<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=190411/whirlwind">Whirlwind</a> spam.</p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=230046">Spiced Wildfowl</a> - Not incredibly important, but works pretty well due to the high mobility requirement and frequent adds.</p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=132444">Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus</a> is ideal, as it's shield can save your life if you're hit by a stray boulder, leave her shielded too long, or allow too many Imps to stack up.</p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=137107">Mannoroth's Bloodletting Manacles</a> are key in allowing you to recover from mistakes. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=132444">Prydaz</a> will keep you alive, but you'll be in a vulnerable position until it comes up again, while <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=137107">Mannoroth's</a> extra healing will allow you to heal up quicker.</p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=137087">Naj'entus's Vertebrae</a> seems good, though I don't think I'd recommend it. Done correctly, the strategy revolves around bursting down groups of adds during cooldowns, outside of which you shouldn't need to be <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=190411/whirlwind">Whirlwinding</a> much.</p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=144259">Kil'jaeden's Burning Wish</a> is a great option for taking out groups of Imps quickly, though I don't think it's required, and given the option would probably favor defensive legendaries instead.</p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=133595">Gronntooth Warhorn</a> - While the trinkets stat increases are underwhelming, the extra damage against demons applies to all targets within the scenario. Certainly not required, in fact there's a lot of leeway with regards to trinkets.</p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=140806">Convergence of Fates</a> - Also not required; <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">Battle Cry</a> is best saved to handle large groups of adds rather than used on cooldown, though <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=140806">Convergence</a> allows it to be used a bit more frequently which helps break her shield. You will need to have a good understanding of the fights timing to use it effectively.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can also find a more comprehensive step-by-step guide to the scenario in my <a class="text-link" href="http://www.wowhead.com/fury-warrior-artifact-challenge">Wowhead Guide</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="naenosguide">Naeno's Guide</h2>
                <p>Here is my personal advice and what I believe is the easiest way of completing the Fury Warrior Mage Tower Scenario for your new artifact appearance. There are various ways of successfully completing this scenario but this is what I found to be the best way for me and others have confirmed as well. I was able to complete this scenario on release day in around twenty or so attempts.</p>
                <h3 id="mechanicsabilities">Mechanics &amp; Abilities</h3>
                <p><strong>Agatha's Fury (Dark Fury)</strong></p>
                <p>This is an infinite interruptible channel that begins when Agatha's energy bar reaches 100. During this channel she deals ticking damage and receives an absorb shield that you must damage through before being able to interrupt the channel. It is crucial to break through the shield and interrupt the channel as soon as possible as she gains a stacking buff which increases the damage of the channel as it goes on. Luckily when her channel is interrupted and she casts it again later in the scenario, the stacking buff is reset and starts once more at zero.</p>
                <p><strong>Imps</strong></p>
                <p>Throughout the scenario Agatha will summon various types of imps. The imps by themselves are relatively easy to deal with but when overlapped with other abilities it can quickly become overwhelming. Here are the imps listed in order of kill importance:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Umbral Imp</strong></p>
                <p>The Umbral Imps are usually spawned in pairs by Agatha and while alive provide her with an immunity buff. Due to this, it is crucial that these imps are killed off as quickly as possible. These imps will also at times teleport away in attempts to kite you.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fuming Imp</strong></p>
                <p>The Fuming Imps are spawned solo and after a moment begin to chase after you. If they reach you, they will start to cast an uninterruptible spell (can be stuned or feared) named Plague Zone. Once this cast goes off, the imp will explode dealing damage to you if you're nearby and also leaving a patch of ground that deals damage to you and slows if standing over it. These patches will persist throughout the entire scenario. It is possible to burst the imp down before they can get the cast off, stun them or even kite them around with Piercing Howl. As long as they don't reach you they will not cast.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Imp Servant</strong></p>
                <p>Occasionally two Imp Servants will spawn on the other end of the cavern. They will both begin to run towards Agatha and once reaching her will start an interruptible channel that feeds her energy and heals her for a minor amount. You can out DPS the healing two imps channeling on Agatha will do but anymore you will be unable to. You should kill these imps off as soon as you can after taking care of the Fuming Imps and Umbral Imps.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Smoldering Imp</strong></p>
                <p>These imps will usually spawn when Agatha spawns a pack of Umbral Imps as well. These imps simply cast Fireballs at you but gain a stacking buff which increases their damage. You shouldn't worry too much about these imps but you should kill them off as soon as you're done dealing with the other imps as the damage they deal can really ramp up.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Boulders</strong></p>
                <p>Once Agatha reaches 50% she will teleport to the back of the room and boulders will begin to drop for the rest of the scenario. These boulders will come down one at a time and either be on the left, right or middle of the room. If you are hit, you will be stunned and almost one shot.</p>
                <p><strong>Translocate</strong></p>
                <p>During the boulder phase, Agatha will cast Translocate every time she loses 10% of her HP. This cast simply teleports her to the other end of the cavern.</p>
                <h3 id="thesecnario">The Secnario</h3>
                <p><strong>Phase 1</strong></p>
                <p>During Phase 1 Agatha will be in the center of the cavern. As soon as you pull her, she will spawn 2-3 Smoldering Imp's. You can just pop <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">Battle Cry</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205545/odyns-fury">Odyn's Fury</a> to burn them down as you continue doing single target damage to her. After a little while she will spawn two Imp Servant's by where you spawned when entering the scenario. At the same time she will also spawn a Fuming Imp under her which will chase you. Deal with the imps as you like (refer to the section above on Fuming Imps) as long as you just don't let them drop patches of Plague Zone in the middle of the path. You want to go ahead and kill the two Imp Servant's channeling on Agatha as soon as you can after you finish dealing with the Fuming Imp. Once they are dead, she'll likely be at high energy and do her first channel of Agatha's Fury (Dark Fury). Damage through her absorb and interrupt the channel. Afterwards she'll likely spawn another Fuming Imp and a set of Umbral Imps alongside Smoldering Imps. Prioritize killing the Umbral Imps first, dealing with the Fuming Imp second and then finishing off the Smoldering Imps last. Two more Imp Servant's will also likely spawn during this as well. </p>
                <p>Throughout the entire phase all these things will keep happening and repeating, sometimes overlapping each other. The worst overlap that can happen is when you have Agatha channeling her spell, Umbral Imps granting her an immunity buff and trying to not drop Plague Zone in sub-optimal areas from the Fuming Imps chasing you around. </p>
                <p><strong>Phase 2</strong></p>
                <p>Once Agatha reaches 50% she will Translocate to the back of the room and boulders will begin to fall at the area she is at. These boulders are of utmost importance and getting hit by them can also guarantee you failing the scenario. Throughout this phase she will continue using her channeling ability and summoning the various types of imps at about the same frequency as in Phase 1. It is even more important during this phase that you do not drop plague zones around her as it'll make it infinitely harder for you to dodge the boulders due to the slow. It is also very important that you kill the Umbral Imps off fast whenever she is channeling as the damage during this phase will be higher due to the damage buff she gains as the scenario progresses. Every 10% she will Translocate to the other end of the cavern and she'll continue repeating her abilities.</p>
                <h3 id="tipstricks">Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
                <p><strong>Talent Setup</strong></p>
                <p>Below is the talent setup I recommend running. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=215556/war-machine">War Machine</a> is a given due to the uptime you'll have on the haste buff and how the movement speed will help you in kiting Fuming Imps and dodging boulders. You do have a choice between <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave">Shockwave</a> or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time">Double Time</a> in the Tier 30 row but I picked <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time">Double Time</a> so I could reach Umbral Adds faster and make use of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202224/furious-charge">Furious Charge</a> more. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=215569/wrecking-ball">Wrecking Ball</a> I feel is stronger than <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar">Avatar</a> due to the constant amount of adds spawned and needing to be killed off quickly. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar">Avatar</a> simply doesn't line up well in this scenario. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202224/furious-charge">Furious Charge</a> is also a given due to the healing it provides and it's synergy with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time">Double Time</a>.</p>
                <p><img class="center-image border" src="/images/fury/mage-tower/naeno-talents.png"></p>
                <p><strong>Food</strong></p>
                <p>Many players have stated that using <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=142334/spiced-falcosaur-omelet">Spiced Wildfowl Omelet</a> has made the scenario much easier due to it being a mini-lust for the encounter with basically 100% uptime. I have no used it myself but many players are like I said raving about it so here it is.</p>
                <p><strong>Ability Usage</strong></p>
                <p>Throughout the encounter you'll want to make use of almost all your abilities to make the scenario much easier. The most important advice I can give is to always save <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">Battle Cry</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205545/odyns-fury">Odyn's Fury</a> for when Agatha spawns a bunch of imps together like the Umbral ones. You shouldn't waste those cooldowns on Servant Imps or when only a few imps are spawned. Fearing the imps and/or using <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=12323/piercing-howl">Piercing Howl</a> on them is also very beneficial and will help you out in the long run so use those wisely. Whenever you are getting low on health you should make use of your Double charges and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202224/furious-charge">Furious Charge</a> to gain back up. The damage you take shouldn't be too much of an issue as long as you are not getting exploded on by the Fuming Imps and are interrupting Agatha's channel.</p>
                <p><strong>Legendaries</strong></p>
                <p>In my honest opinion, there are three legendaries that shine in this scenario. Those being <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=132444">Prydaz</a>, the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=137107">healing bracers</a> and the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=137087">whirlwind belt</a>. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=132444">Prydaz</a> is MVP in this scenario and will mitigate a lot of damage while also giving you more room for error due to it's large absorb. The <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=137107">healing bracers</a> are what I think to be the second best legendary you can equip as it'll give you even more room for error due to the survivability boost it'll give you through it's healing combined with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202224/furious-charge">Furious Charge</a>. Afterwards the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=137087">whirlwind belt</a> is a clear choice due to it's synergy with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=215569/wrecking-ball">Wrecking Ball</a> and there always being more than 3 adds up.</p>
                <p><strong>Dealing with Phase 1</strong></p>
                <p>You can go about dealing with Phase 1 in different ways but this is what I found to be the most effective for me. I'd start the encounter by popping <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">Battle Cry</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage">Rampage</a> and then <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205545/odyns-fury">Odyn's Fury</a> to burn down the initial adds she spawns. Afterwards I'd continue to DPS her as the two Imp Servant's spawn and begin to walk to her. Even then when they start channeling on her I'd continue DPS as you should be able to out-heal them. During this time I'd also be kiting the Fuming Imp around the boss in a circle, keeping it slowed with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=12323/piercing-howl">Piercing Howl</a>. Once Agatha spawns the umbral imps I'd proceed to pop <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">Battle Cry</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205545/odyns-fury">Odyn's Fury</a> to burn them down instantly. You continue repeating this, making sure to always save <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">BC</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205545/odyns-fury">OF</a> for when many imps are out and interrupting Agatha's channel as soon as possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Dealing with Phase 2</strong></p>
                <p>Phase 2 can easily be the most challenging part of the scenario or the easiest. The challenging part of phase 2 is when you are in the upper half of the cavern where the boulders drop down right next to you. It becomes very difficult to kite the Fuming Imp around and if any Plague Zone is dropped in a bad spot there you can easily be done for due to the slow and being an easy target for a boulder. During phase 2 my strategy was to simply zerg Agatha. I'd still hold onto my cooldowns for the Umbral Imps but I wouldn't kill off any of the Servant Imp's unless there was more than two. This is because every 10% health she loses she teleports to the other side of the room. When she does this, using <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=12323/piercing-howl">Piercing Howl</a> on all the imps and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6544/heroic-leap">Heroic Leap</a> after her, creating a lot of distance between yourself and the imps. You should be able to continue zerging her, only dealing with the imps when you have your <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">Battle Cry</a> and/or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205545/odyns-fury">Odyn's Fury</a> up or if Umbral Imps are making her immune. </p>
                <p>It's important to stay calm during this phase, prioritize dodging the boulders, making sure you don't drop Plague Zone's in bad spots, killing the Umbral Imps and interrupting Agatha's channel as soon as possible. I'd suggest lusting with drums once you get her to 20% as it becomes infinitely easier to nuke her once you can start executing.</p>
