                        <p>After getting a chance to play not one, but both specs through full clears of Uldir, I'm pretty happy to say that they both play very well.</p>
                        <p><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Archimtiros/status/1037970723006889984">Bragging</a> about my own ranks aside, most already know that Arms is outperforming Fury right now, in part due to general tuning and in part due to having a generally better toolkit. That said, Fury isn't as bad as it looks on the WarcraftLogs <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/19">performance statistics</a> - there just aren't nearly as many people playing it, with 2.3k Fury v 8.8k Arms Heroic parses and 30.4k Fury v 56.8k Arms Normal parses. When most of the better geared players are all playing the same spec (as is expected in a new tier), the other one always looks worse as a result.</p>
                        <p>Critiquing both specs real quick:</p>
                        <p>Arms feels <em>really</em> good, especially at higher gear levels.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>I was initially dismissive of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260643/skullsplitter">Skullsplitter</a>, but it has grown on me over the last few weeks - the ability to generate on demand rage is a much bigger advantage than the tooltip would imply.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260708/sweeping-strikes">Sweeping Strikes</a> is inordinately useful due to the number of encounters with close range, short-lived adds, which is more alike to Tomb of Sargeras than Antorus.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262161/warbreaker">Warbreaker</a> + <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> is unparalleled for raw burst and on a short enough cooldown that it's nearly always available when you want it.</li>
                        <li>To cap it off, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=281001/massacre">Massacre</a> works very well on a number of bosses who have vulnerability or burn phases near the end of the encounter (Taloc, MOTHER, Fetid, Zek'voz, Zul).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By contrast, Fury <em>feels</em> good, but can't hide its shortcomings. The general rotation is still just as much fun to play as it was in pre-patch Antorus, but some issues stand out.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Fury simply doesn't have the tools to compete with Arms; its sustained multitarget through <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1680/whirlwind">Whirlwind</a> is theoretically strong, but no real practical situation for it - any time you have that many adds, they're burst down. Speaking of burst, Fury's <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=46924/bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> is fairly commensurate to Arms', but missing Warbreaker/<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar">Avatar</a>/<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262111/mastery-deep-wounds">Deep Wounds</a> which push Arms over the top. Couple that with the generally long cooldown, and Fury feels like it's frequently struggling to build the momentum that Arms has every time <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash">Colossus Smash</a>/Warbreaker come back off cooldown.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280772/siegebreaker">Siegebreaker</a> reminds me of MoP Colossus Smash (which I loved), but when I play it, I realize the rotation has changed so much that it just doesn't work anymore. The preparation, timing, and strict cooldown were fine in a spec which was designed around it, but now only stifle an otherwise fluid and reactive rotation, so although I <em>want</em> to like it, it's a bit of a let down for me.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=202922/carnage">Carnage</a> is <em>so</em> strong, it completely outweighs <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=206315/massacre">Massacre</a>, even with those fights that it <em>should</em> be good for. It's just disappointing really.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I expect tuning to hit sometime between tomorrow (Friday) and Monday, so it's hard to say what will happen when Mythic opens next week. I kind of expect Arms to see some nerfs, but it's not nearly as egregious as some other specs at the moment, so I have no idea what will really happen. Rest assured, as soon as there <em>are</em> changes, I'll get to work on analyzing them and updating guides for you all.</p>
                        <p>Until then, I hope everyone is having a good time in Uldir, and BfA so far in general. It's not a perfect expansion by a long shot, and may be plagued by bugs, but I've found it to be enjoyable overallâ€¦ though it could just be the fresh content keeping me preoccupied! As a reminder, all of my Arms and Fury guides on Icy-Veins and Wowhead were updated for Uldir release, with new Azerite rankings, BiS, Rotations, Talents, and entirely new Mythic+ and Raid tips pages with talent and strategic recommendations which I'll also be updating as the Season/Tier progresses, so check those out and let me know how well it matches up with your experiences so far.</p>
