At this point, Fury remains largely unchanged, although there have been scant hints of works in progress. The rotation still largely revolves around [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) and [Enrage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage), and a few small improvements have been added, although many of the same issues we’ve dealt with throughout Legion remain. Most importantly, none of the artifact traits or legendary gear perks have been carried over as of this point.

# What’s been removed

- All artifact traits, including [Odyn’s Fury](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=205545/odyns-fury). As a result, rage generation has been reduced by approximately 30%.
<br>
<br>
- Legendaries work through level 115, though a tuning pass is expected before launch.
<br>
<br>
- [Shockwave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave) is now Protection-only.

# What’s been added

- [Impending Victory](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory) is now a talent, which replaces [Shockwave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave).

# What’s different

- [Enrage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage) lasts 6 seconds (up from 4), but increases attack speed by 50% (down from 100%).
<br>
<br>
- Taste for Blood (Furious Slash buff) increases crit by 20% per stack (up from 15%).
<br>
<br>
- [Meat Cleaver](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=257019/meat-cleaver) (Whirlwind buff) now cleaves [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) and [Bloodthirst](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23881/bloodthirst) at 40% damage (down from 50%).
<br>
<br>
- [Avatar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar) generates 20 rage on use.
<br>
<br>
- [Inner Rage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215573/inner-rage) increases Raging Blow damage by 100% (down from 150%).
<br>
<br>
- [Bloodbath](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12292/bloodbath) deals direct damage on cast (similar to Dragon Roar).
<br>
<br>
- Battle Cry and Commanding Shout have been renamed [Recklessness](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1719/recklessness) and [Rallying Cry](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=97462/rallying-cry) respectively.
<br>
<br>
- [Recklessness](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1719/recklessness), [Bloodbath](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12292/bloodbath), [Avatar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar), and [Rallying Cry](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=97462/rallying-cry) are now on the GCD at 1.5s; Charge is on the GCD at 0.5s.
<br>
<br>
- Due to the loss of rage generation from the artifact and legendaries, the average time between [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) casts is greatly increased (from ~5-8s to ~8-12s), although the increased duration of Enrage keeps Enrage uptime mostly relative.

# Talents

There have been few talent changes so far, though other changes have impacted their use considerably.

<h3>15 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215556/war-machine" rel="spell=215556" data-wh-icon-size="small">War Machine</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202296/endless-rage" rel="spell=202296" data-wh-icon-size="small">Endless Rage</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215568/fresh-meat" rel="spell=215568" data-wh-icon-size="small">Fresh Meat</a></h3>

- [Fresh Meat](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215568/fresh-meat) is theoretically better for short combats without [Recklessness](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1719/recklessness) because of less [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) use due to reduced rage generation, but [Bloodthirst’s](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23881/bloodthirst) crit chance is still unreliable, and [War Machine](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215556/war-machine) will continue to outperform in sustained combat or when chain pulling multiple targets.

<h3>30 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time" rel="spell=103827" data-wh-icon-size="small">Double Time</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory" rel="spell=202168" data-wh-icon-size="small">Impending Victory</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107570/storm-bolt" rel="spell=107570" data-wh-icon-size="small">Storm Bolt</a></h3>

- The removal of [Shockwave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave) makes [Storm Bolt](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107570/storm-bolt) more useful by default, though the prevalence of other class stuns and competition with [Double Time](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time) will make it situationally useful at best.
<br>
<br>
- Due to reduced rage generation, [Impending Victory](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory) is a poor trade at 15% heal for 10 rage. [Double Time](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time) + [Furious Charge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202224/furious-charge) will amount to more healing in most situations, at a net rage positive.

<h3>45 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215569/wrecking-ball" rel="spell=215569" data-wh-icon-size="small">Wrecking Ball</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=206320/outburst" rel="spell=206320" data-wh-icon-size="small">Outburst</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar" rel="spell=107574" data-wh-icon-size="small">Avatar</a></h3>

- [Avatar’s](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar) rage generation is mostly wasted, since it’s typically followed by [Recklessness](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1719/recklessness) with [Reckless Abandon](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202751/reckless-abandon). Being on the GCD makes it more problematic to use, though doesn’t hurt the ability as much as others due to its longer duration.

<h3>60 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202224/furious-charge" rel="spell=202224" data-wh-icon-size="small">Furious Charge</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202163/bounding-stride" rel="spell=202163" data-wh-icon-size="small">Bounding Stride</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=208154/warpaint" rel="spell=208154" data-wh-icon-size="small">Warpaint</a></h3>

- No changes.

<h3>75 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202922/carnage" rel="spell=202922" data-wh-icon-size="small">Carnage</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=206315/massacre" rel="spell=206315" data-wh-icon-size="small">Massacre</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215571/frothing-berserker" rel="spell=215571" data-wh-icon-size="small">Frothing Berserker</a></h3>

- [Frothing Berserker’s](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215571/frothing-berserker) uptime is reduced as a result of lower rage generation, which also makes [Carnage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202922/carnage) more attractive, though it is still offers the most synergy alongside [Reckless Abandon](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202751/reckless-abandon).

<h3>90 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=206313/frenzy" rel="spell=206313" data-wh-icon-size="small">Frenzy</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215573/inner-rage" rel="spell=215573" data-wh-icon-size="small">Inner Rage</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12292/bloodbath" rel="spell=12292" data-wh-icon-size="small">Bloodbath</a></h3>

- [Bloodbath](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12292/bloodbath) being placed on the GCD makes the ability harder to line up with other buffs, and although it now deals direct damage, that actually makes it harder to use effectively, due to wanting to buff it with both [Recklessness](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1719/recklessness) and [Enrage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage), which would require pooling [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) beforehand to best overlap the buffs.
<br>
<br>
- [Inner Rage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215573/inner-rage) is significantly weaker due to the damage nerf. It still condenses 2 Raging Blows into 1 global, but now only deals 2 [Raging Blows](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=85288/raging-blow) worth of damage instead of 2.5, meaning all you gain is 1 global’s worth of damage, typically a [Furious Slash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=100130/furious-slash). It’s unlikely that [Furious Slash’s](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=100130/furious-slash) weak direct damage and [Bloodthirst](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23881/bloodthirst) crit buff make up for the opportunity cost of 5 rage generation and using another talent instead, although [Inner Rage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215573/inner-rage) is the only way to effectively cleave [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage), due to it’s weak base damage and [Enrage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage) requirement.
<br>
<br>
- [Frenzy](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=206313/frenzy) hasn’t changed, although it is useful on the beta, due to premade characters very low starting Haste.

<h3>100 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202751/reckless-abandon" rel="spell=202751" data-wh-icon-size="small">Reckless Abandon</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=118000/dragon-roar" rel="spell=118000" data-wh-icon-size="small">Dragon Roar</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46924/bladestorm" rel="spell=46924" data-wh-icon-size="small">Bladestorm</a></h3>

- [Reckless Abandon](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202751/reckless-abandon) is slightly weaker due to the GCD changes; [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) can no longer be clipped into [Recklessness](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1719/recklessness), and the GCD between casting [Recklessness](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1719/recklessness) and [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) will waste any rage generated from auto-attacks during that time. That said, it remains the go-to talent on the tier.
<br>
<br>
- [Dragon Roar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=118000/dragon-roar) is an extra GCD which simply gets in the way of other abilities, even more so after the GCD changes.
<br>
<br>
- [Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46924/bladestorm) is relatively better, due to being the only burst AoE ability after the removal of [Odyn’s Fury](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=205545/odyns-fury), though still suffers all of the same issues of being difficult to align with [Recklessness](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1719/recklessness) and [Enrage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage). If anything, it’s made even worse due to the inability to increased GCD conflict with [Bloodbath](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12292/bloodbath) and [Avatar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar).

# Azerite Traits (many values are placeholder)

<br>
<br>
- [Pulverizing Blows](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275632/pulverizing-blows) – [Raging Blows](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=85288/raging-blow) causes every strike of your next [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) to deal an additional 6 damage. Stacks up to 5 times.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
- [Trample the Weak](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=272836/trample-the-weak) – [Rampaging](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) an enemy whose health percentage is lower than yours increases your Versatility by 0 for 6 seconds.

# Overview

## Rage Generation and Enrage

The loss of artifact traits and legendaries has reduced rage generation by approximately 30%, which increases the average time between [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) casts from ~5-8s to ~8-12s. This is offset by [Enrage’s](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage) duration being increased to 6 seconds, keeping Fury at roughly 70% [Enrage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage) uptime, which is just slightly lower than live, but has the secondary effect of making the rotation feel slower, even though the actual amount of actions per minute remains the same.

There’s a natural conflict at work, as rage generation (and the frequency of [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage)) cannot be increased without also reducing the duration of Enrage, or else [Enrage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage) uptime will increase as a result. While many players would certainly like that, it limits the specs potential for growth and even negatively impacts the rotation, since [Furious Slash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=100130/furious-slash) would have even less of a place in the rotation, effectively limiting the four rotational buttons ([Bloodthirst](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23881/bloodthirst), [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage), [Raging Blow](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=85288/raging-blow), and [Furious Slash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=100130/furious-slash)) to a repetitive three.

## Talents and Toolkit, comparison to Arms

While the core rotation is solid, the biggest issue is with Fury’s talents. Due to being put on the GCD, the many talented cooldowns now compete rather than complement one another, and there’s still an alarming number of vastly underutilized talents taking up space on the tree ([Fresh Meat](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215568/fresh-meat), [Impending Victory](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory), [Outburst](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=206320/outburst), [Furious Charge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202224/furious-charge), [Dragon Roar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=118000/dragon-roar)).

The GCD change to offensive abilities isn’t likely to go anywhere, but it’s not a major concern when using only one cooldown. Trying to use multiple, and trying to sync them with [Enrage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage) in particular becomes a jumbled mess as a significant portion of each cooldown’s duration is spent on its own GCD and casting the next buff. For an already GCD locked spec, where each ability fuels the rotation by generating rage for [Rampage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184367/rampage) or increases crit chance for [Bloodthirst](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23881/bloodthirst), it’s like throwing a wrench into a well oiled machine - it simply slows down the entire thing.

Most problematic is Fury’s overall weak toolkit. Arms covers Execute, 2 target ([Sweeping Strikes](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=260708/sweeping-strikes)), 3-5 target (talented [Cleave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=845/cleave)), burst AoE ([Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm)/talented [Ravager](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=152277/ravager)), while by contrast Fury is has abysmal multi-target potential and its talented burst AoE ([Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46924/bladestorm)) fits into the rotation awkwardly at best; even Fury’s [Execute](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=5308/execute) is hampered without talenting into [Massacre](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=206315/massacre), with significant opportunity cost. Fury simply doesn’t excel anywhere, unless it ends up significantly overtuned.
