More of a gap than last tier, this time in Fury's favor. Does that mean Fury will outperform Arms overall? Maybe. Arms tends to see bigger gains from Cleave, short or intermittent Execute phases, and lose less from downtime, while Fury should fare better at burst AoE due to new tier bonuses. Ultimately, individual encounter mechanics and popular strategy will be the largest deciding factors.

My advice is simple - <u>play what you enjoy</u>. If you like something, you're more likely to invest in it, spend time learning the nuance, and be successful at it.
