For [Khaz'goroth's Courage](http://www.wowhead.com/item=154176/khazgoroths-courage) empowerment, Mastery and Haste are effectively equal, though Mastery will perform better if the empowerment happens to line up with burst AoE. Regardless, you will always want more Haste and Mastery, and there's no realistic soft-cap or breakpoint which causes them to fall significantly below Versatility or Critical Strike. Unless it comes with a notable ilevel gain, or another special separate bonus, minimize Critical Strike as much as possible.

### Sim yo'self

It's important to understand the general relationship between stats, but when presented with multiple stats with near equal values, stat weights can just as often be misleading, since a strong weight may not always stay that strong. Generally speaking, Mastery tends to remain consistently strong and Critical Strike consistently weak, while Haste and Versatility fluctuate the most, but to use stat weights effectively, you should ideally re-sim every time your stats change by more than a few percent.

This is also why *"sim your own stat weights to find out which is best for you"* is a good general rule, but not always good advice - if you only do it once and aren't constantly reevaluating, your stat weights will only show a snapshot in time, and may not project far enough ahead to give an accurate assessment of long-term growth, nor do they account for *trading* one stat for another. You could very well have stat weights which favors Mastery, change all of your gems and enchants, only to find yourself worse off than before, with Haste as the new top weight. There's a very good blog post on <a class="text-link" href="http://www.peakofserenity.com/2016/09/14/stat-weights-and-you/">Peak of Serenity</a> about this.

### Breakpoints

There are a lot of them, actually. The most important ones are ~27% Haste, with another ~50% which is generally out of reach without a large haste buff (Heroism, [Frenzy](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=206313/frenzy), [War Machine](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=215556/war-machine)).

Each of these steps at 17%, 21%, 30%, 37%, 42%, and 50% (values rounded) are also breakpoints, with even smaller steps interspersed between. Remember, breakpoints aren't always as straightforward as "more GCDs during Battle Cry", but can be associated with [Enrage](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=184361/enrage), [Frothing Berserker](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=215571/frothing-berserker), Rage generation, tier bonuses, and so on - meaning your particular gear may shift, add, or remove them entirely.<br>

With [Ceann-ar Charger](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137088/ceann-ar-charger), Haste, Mastery, and Versatility are all fairly consistent, with Haste ahead, Verse/Mastery nearly identical. Note the significant drop with any loss of Haste (moving left).<br>

With [Soul of the Battlelord](http://www.wowhead.com/item=151650/soul-of-the-battlelord), Haste and Mastery are fairly well intertwined, with a slight peak at ~+1300 Haste (30-31%), and a notable drop off at -1000 (26%). This profile sitting between two breaks illustrates how quickly Haste can go from an average stat to a very important one, depending on how close you are to those points.<br>

When using [Soul of the Battlelord](http://www.wowhead.com/item=151650/soul-of-the-battlelord), trading Haste for Mastery is favorable up until that same point (~26% Haste).<br>
<img class="image-margin center-image border" src="/images/fury/stats/breakpoints-4.png">

Without [Convergence of Fates](http://www.wowhead.com/item=140806/convergence-of-fates), crit rises dramatically, and provides the best balance of stats overall, though Haste still has notable breakpoints (see left side deprecation), and this balance isn't enough reason to drop [CoF](http://www.wowhead.com/item=140806/convergence-of-fates) altogether.<br>
<img class="image-margin center-image border" src="/images/fury/stats/breakpoints-5.png">

These examples show why it's good to sim your own stats regularly, rather than just once and assuming those weights will remain consistent; however, there remains a constant in that Haste and Mastery remain universally strong stats and they rarely drop for any length of time. Therefore, the easy rule is to simply prioritize those, and sim close gear changes when necessary.



### Pawn

Use at your own risk; individual gear and resulting stat weights won't necessarily match these. Keep in mind that Pawn does not account for bonus effects and can end up misleading unless constantly updating the string after gear changes.
