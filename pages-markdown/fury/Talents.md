## TL;DR

<img class="border" src="/images/fury/talents/talents.png">

<ul>
<li>Substitute War Machine when adds are present.</li>
<li>Wrecking Ball is worth using if you're consistently using Whirlwind outside of cooldowns, such as in Mythic+.</li>
<li>Bounding Stride and Warpaint are interchangeable depending on the need for mobility or damage reduction.</li>
</ul>

### "Why Bloodbath?"

It synergizes very well with the T21 bonuses, which in turn synergize well with Soul of the Battlelord, while Inner Rage is devalued by the loss of T20 and general lack of Raging Blow use during the Execute phase.

The tier bonus and reliance on stacked cooldowns does make Fury's damage burstier, with higher spikes and lower falls, but the damage potential is quite impressive, especially with Execute.

Spec Bloodbath once you have at least 2p T21, preferably with 4p.

### Other Talents

<img class="border" src="/images/fury/talents/other-talents.png">

<ul>
<li>Massacre and Carnage replace Soul of the Battlelord with Ceann-ar Charger.</li>
<li>Carnage is very competitive when there is no Execute phase, or in sustained cleave (Mythic+).</li>
<img class="border" style="margin-top: 0.6rem" src="/images/fury/talents/carnage.png">
<li>Frothing is still stronger when dealing AoE only during Battle Cry.</li>
<li>Inner Rage isn't very competitive in raids, but does smooth out the damage profile, and is still very useful in short/intermittent combat, such as open world questing, due to non-reliance on Enrage.</li>
</ul>

**The Forgotten Ones**

<ul>
<li>Fresh Meat doesn't provided a large enough buff to ensure Bloodthirst critical strikes, or last long enough in raid encounters.</li>
<li>Shockwave or Storm Bolt can be used, but there are plenty of other classes which bring stuns without opportunity cost.</li>
<li>Outburst has very little DPS potential, since Enrage can be reliably triggered with Rampage and Battle Cry.</li>
<li>Furious Charge has some benefit while leveling or chaining solo combat, but isn't practical for group content with healer roles.</li>
<li>Bladestorm doesn't perform well due to not fitting inside Enrage or Battle Cry, and competing with Odyn's Fury.</li>
<li>Dragon Roar's buff is outclassed by the extra time added by Reckless Abandon.</li>
</ul>
