Fury doesn't have much room for trinket customization, as one slot will be dedicated to [Convergence of Fates](http://www.wowhead.com/item=140806/convergence-of-fates), and the other to a Pantheon trinket. If not using one or the other, refer to these lists.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=140806/convergence-of-fates">Convergence of Fates</a> does not require a high ilevel to be effective, although the additional strength is beneficial. Keep in mind that some encounters will require <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">Battle Cry</a> to be delayed, which can significantly devalue the trinket.</li>
<li>AoE trinkets such as <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=147012/umbral-moonglaives">Umbral Moonglaives</a> are still situationally useful.</li>

### Why CoF is still good

Ignoring Haste for the sake of simplicity:

Over the course of a minute, CoF gives roughly 25s of CDR (5x5); nerfing that down to 4s reduces the CDR to 20s (4x5).

That's not the same as reducing BC's CD by 25(20)s, however, because BC isn't on a 1m CD. It's on a 50s CD, reduced by Odyn's Champion for an average of ~40s.

So at 5.16 RPPM, or avg 11.62 seconds per proc, you would only fit 3-4 procs within the adjusted CD of BC, giving you 15-20 (12-16)s of reduction per Battle Cry.

Then take into account that the CDR takes place during the natural cooldown over time, which reduces the overall amount of procs per cycle; in actuality 3-4 procs is more like 2-3 if you're lucky, or even 1-2 if you're not.

Therefore, instead of getting 5-15s of reduction (avg 10s), the change to 4s per proc makes that 4-12s (avg 8s) per Battle Cry, making it a very ineffective change.

### Pantheon Trinkets in Antorus

<ul>
<li>Warriors can only obtain <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=154173/aggramars-conviction">Aggramar's</a> (Tank), <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=154176/khazgoroths-courage">Khaz'goroth's</a> (Strength), and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=154172/amanthuls-vision">Aman'thul's</a> (Wildcard).</li>
<li>While <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=154172/amanthuls-vision">Aman'thul's</a> starts out stronger at ilevel 1000, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=154176/khazgoroths-courage">Khaz'goroth's</a> can be upgraded over time with <a href="Pantheon's Blessing">Pantheon's Blessing</a> and has the better Empowerment.</li>
<li>Empowerment only works inside Antorus, and requires overlapping four unique trinket buffs (substituting any number of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=154172/amanthuls-vision">Aman'thul's</a>) within the raid at the same time, which will trigger the secondary buff on only those four players.</li>
</ul>
