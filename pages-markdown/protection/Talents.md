With how things have played out, Protection Warriors don't have a ton of choice when it comes to talents. Some are simply more weak in every situation, while with others you're locked into them because of how well they synergize with certain talents, gear, etc. For example, when running [Tier 20 4 set + Tier 21 2 set](https://skyhold.gg/protection/tier-21/), talents that synergize with or increase rage are the go-to.

## **TL;DR**

<u>Use [Vengeance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202572/vengeance) if you're *not* wearing Tier 20 4 set + Tier 21 2 set.</u><br>
Use [Safeguard](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=223657/safeguard) for high level Mythic+. [Impending Victory](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory) for solo content or if you can't make good use of Safeguard.

Otherwise, use:

## **Tier 1**

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave" rel="spell=46968" data-wh-icon-size="small">Shockwave</a>
</h3>

Useful when you need an AoE stun and [Warbringer](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=103828/warbringer) can't be used effectively (e.g. no melee in your group, or you need [Intercept](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198304/intercept) for movement).

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=107570/storm-bolt" rel="spell=107570" data-wh-icon-size="small">Stormbolt</a>
</h3>

A longer, single-target stun. This is generally going to be a pretty niche talent, as anytime you can stun something you're probably better off with one of the other two talents anyway. This *can* be used as filler when you're running [Devastator](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=236279/devastator) and have nothing to cast. However, this isn't recommended as you don't know when you'll get a [Shield Slam](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam) proc from an auto-attack, and the DPS gain in negligible.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=103828/warbringer" rel="spell=103828" data-wh-icon-size="small">Warbringer</a>
</h3>

This talent is really great for a few reasons. Firstly, *this stun does not have diminishing returns*. If enemies can't be stunned due to DR, you can still stun them with [Warbringer](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=103828/warbringer). Secondly, you don't have to [Intercept](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198304/intercept) an enemy to stun enemies within 5 yards. If there's a friendly target (DPS, pets, etc.) next to the enemies you want to stun, you can [Intercept](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198304/intercept) that friendly and everything within 5 yards of that friendly will be stunned. Finally, and this is really minor, your [Intercept](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198304/intercept) will do a bit of extra damage to stunnable targets.

## **Tier 2**

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory" rel="spell=202168" data-wh-icon-size="small">Impending Victory</a>
</h3>

It's a relatively small heal, it's on the GCD, has a 30 second cooldown, and it costs rage. Definitely not the greatest talent ever. It *can* be quite useful for solo content or in dungeons where you're low on rage and don't have enough for Ignore Pain. It's worth noting that if you get a [Victory Rush](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=34428/victory-rush) proc, you will still heal for 30% instead of 15%. This talent doesn't make actual Victory Rush procs weaker.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205484/inspiring-presence" rel="spell=205484" data-wh-icon-size="small">Inspiring Presence</a>
</h3>

The go-to choice for any raid content. This talent provides a non-insignificant amount of healing for your raid. On Mythic fights with a lot of raid damage, it's not uncommon for this talent to provide almost 500k HPS. It can definitely help lessen the load on your healers. This talent doesn't stack, so if there's another Protection Warrior in the group with it selected, you should switch to a different talent.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=223657/safeguard" rel="spell=223657" data-wh-icon-size="small">Safeguard</a>
</h3>

This talent can be extremely useful in high level Mythic+ as you can help reduce the damage of mechanics that would otherwise one-shot the DPS/healer. The same can also be said for raids. You can use it on your co-tank to help reduce the damage of certain mechanics, smooth out their damage intake, etc. *However*, unless you have a really good reason to use it (e.g. it was very useful for Odyn spears in ToV), you're better off running [Inspiring Presence](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205484/inspiring-presence) for your raid.

## **Tier 3**

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202288/renewed-fury" rel="spell=202288" data-wh-icon-size="small">Renwed Fury</a>
</h3>

With how much rage we're able to generate and with how much we're able to cast [Ignore Pain](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain), you can quite easily get very close to 100% uptime of this talent. That alone makes this talent the best choice in this tier for essentially every situation.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202560/best-served-cold" rel="spell=202560" data-wh-icon-size="small">Best Served Cold</a>
</h3>

This *can* provide a lot of DPS if you're able to consistently hit 5 targets and dump rage into [Revenge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge) constantly, but in most scenarios there either aren't enough targets, or you need to cast [Ignore Pain](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain) to survive so you won't get enough [Revenge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge) casts off to make this worthwhile. Another way to look at it is this: If [Revenge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge) is more than 40% of your total damage *before taking into account [Best Served Cold](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202560/best-served-cold)*, then it will beat out [Renewed Fury](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202288/renewed-fury) at 100% uptime *if you're hitting 5 targets*. If you include BSC, [Revenge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge) needs to be more than ~45% of your total damage at 5 targets. Including BSC, you need more than 60% total damage at 4 targets. Having Revenge be at ~45% of your total damage against 5 targets is already pretty rare. If there are less than 5 targets, this talent is guaranteed to lose as it's essentially impossible for Revenge to be such a large % of your damage.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar" rel="spell=107574" data-wh-icon-size="small">Avatar</a>
</h3>

In previous patches, when we used to generate a lot less rage (so less [Renewed Fury](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202288/renewed-fury) uptime), and DPS was all about doing as much damage as possible within [Battle Cry](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry), this talent was generally the go-to. Especially in dungeons where you had time to let this cooldown between packs of enemies. However, with how high [Renewed Fury](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202288/renewed-fury) uptime is now, Avatar simply provides less DPS in most situations. It does have the advantage of removing roots and snares, so if there's a situation where that utility is really useful, this may be worth taking.

## **Tier 4**

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=223662/warlords-challenge" rel="spell=223662" data-wh-icon-size="small">Warlord's Challenge</a>
</h3>

This is the go-to talent in essentially all situations. Mainly because of the Tier 20 <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=242302/item-warrior-t20-protection-2p-bonus" rel="spell=242302">2 set</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=242373/item-warrior-t20-protection-4p-bonus" rel="spell=242373">4 set</a> bonuses. Not only does it provide you with rage with those set bonuses (which synergizes with other talents/gear), it's also extremely useful on its own. In dungeons, you can easily pick up distant adds, and in raids it's great for getting a boss into position or fixing a mis-taunt.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202163/bounding-stride" rel="spell=202163" data-wh-icon-size="small">Bounding Stride</a>
</h3>

Very useful if you *need* the mobility this talent provides.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=203201/crackling-thunder" rel="spell=203201" data-wh-icon-size="small">Crackling Thunder</a>
</h3>

Really only useful for dungeons, and even then you're better off with [Warlord's Challenge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=223662/warlords-challenge) as it can more or less accomplish the same thing and more.

## **Tier 5**

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=236279/devastator" rel="spell=236279" data-wh-icon-size="small">Devastator</a>
</h3>

This replaces/removes [Devastate](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=20243/devastate). Your auto attacks now do the same thing as if you were to cast Devastate, with the bonus of generating an additional 5 rage. Because of the frequency at which you're able to cast other abilities (due to Shield Slam procs, Revenge procs, and Thunder Clap), you'll rarely have empty GCDs. In other words, you're essentially casting Devastates while also casting your other abilities. This leads to more [Shield Slam](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam) procs, which gives you more rage (to spend on Ignore Pain) and damage. Overall, this talent is a large increase to both damage and survivability. Since its introduction in 7.1.5, there have been very few situations in which it was worthwhile to use another talent on this tier.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202561/never-surrender" rel="spell=202561" data-wh-icon-size="small">Never Surrender</a>
</h3>

This talent provides a linear increase to [Ignore Pain](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain) size based on your missing health. That is, on cast, your Ignore Pain is increased by the % of your *missing* health. If you were going to cast an IP for 100 absorb, but you're at 25% health, you would instead get an absorb for 175. So, this talent isn't *terrible* by any means, the problem is that it's simply worse in every situation compared to the other two talents in this tier.

<h3>
<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202095/indomitable" rel="spell=202095" data-wh-icon-size="small">Indomitable</a>
</h3>

Indomitable increases your health by 20%, and increases the size of every [Ignore Pain](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain) by 20%. It's a pretty simple talent in practice. It's very good for increasing your EHP so you can survive burst damage. However, compared to [Devastator](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=236279/devastator), it loses when it comes to total healing, and burst damage should be mitigated with proper CD usage, not padding your health pool. Not only that, but you lose out on a *lot* of DPS by not running [Devastator](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=236279/devastator).
