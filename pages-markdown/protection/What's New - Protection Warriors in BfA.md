While many specs are staying more or less the same going into Battle for Azeroth, Protection Warrior is once again getting some fairly significant changes. This is by no means a bad thing. While Prot was fun in Legion, it definitely had its share of issues. In BfA, our core gameplay, i.e. [Devastate](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=20243/devastate)/[Shield Slam](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam)/[Thunder Clap](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6343/thunder-clap)/[Revenge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge), remains more or less the same. The major changes are to our rage generation model, talents, and baseline abilities.

**<u>Prot Warrior is still incomplete and we will definitely see more changes before BfA is released. Nothing is set in stone.</u>**

This post will be updated as new changes are released.

# Baseline

## What's being removed

- Of course, our [Artifact](http://wowhead.com/item=128289/scale-of-the-earth-warder) and everything that comes with it
- [Ignore Pain](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain) - At the moment, there is nothing that is baseline that replaces Ignore Pain
- [Battle Cry](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry) - Replaced with [Avatar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar)
- Rage Generation - RFDT (Rage from Damage Taken) has been removed. More on this below.

There are a *lot* of talent changes as well. Those are covered below.

## What's being added

- [Avatar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar) - This is now our baseline damage cooldown and it also generates 20 rage
- [Battle Shout](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6673/battle-shout)
- [Intimidating Shout](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=5246/intimidating-shout)
- [Rallying Cry](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=97462/rallying-cry)
- [Shockwave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave) - Shockwave is now baseline. The cooldown reduction when you hit 3+ targets has been moved to a talent.
- [Defensive Stance](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=71/defensive-stance) - The 30% stamina increase is nothing new. We've had that for at least the last two expansions, it was just a hidden passive. The strength -> armor conversion *is* new though.

## What's being changed

I am ignoring any damage/tuning changes, any rage generation/cost changes, and any changes due to the loss of the artifact.

- [Demoralizing Shout](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1160/demoralizing-shout) - Now on a 45 second cooldown.
- [Shield Block](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=2565/shield-block) - Recharge time changed to 18 seconds. It still has 2 charges. Rage cost increased to 40. I'm mentioning this because it has a fairly large impact on gameplay (more on that below).
- [Spell Reflection](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23920/spell-reflection) - Now reduces magic damage by 15%.
- [Thunder Clap](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6343/thunder-clap) - The slow is now 20% instead of 50%.

## Rage Generation

We no longer gain rage based on the damage we take. There are two sources of rage besides what we gain from abilities:

1. We gain 2 rage from *our* auto attacks.
2. We gain 3 rage from enemy auto attacks.

We do not gain rage from avoidance events (i.e. if the enemy parries/dodges or if we parry/dodge).<br>Firstly, this means that rage generation will likely be more or less consistent throughout the expansion. If things scale as they should, this won't really be an issue (yeah, that's a big "if"). However, because we gain 3 rage when we get meleed, and because there is no ICD (or it is extremely short), the rage generation when tanking one target compared to tanking multiple targets is massive.

On single-target, you generally feel a bit rage starved. When tanking 4+ targets that melee you, you usually quite literally cannot spend your rage fast enough to not cap, particularly because you're getting many more free [Revenges](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge).

# Talents

The most significant changes are to our talents. Rather than list out all of the changes, I'll just go over how they are right now on Beta.<br><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/protection">Beta Talent Calculator</a>

<h3>15 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202603/into-the-fray" rel="spell=202603" data-wh-icon-size="small">Into the Fray</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275334/punish" rel="spell=275334" data-wh-icon-size="small">Punish</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory" rel="spell=202168" data-wh-icon-size="small">Impending Victory</a></h3>

- Into the Fray is now vastly better than it was on Live. It counts allies as well, making it very easy to keep up the buff at full or close to full stacks.
- Punish is also a fairly good talent. It's essentially a permanent 5% DR on single-target. The debuff is applied to the enemy, not you. In other words, when you [Shield Slam](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam) an enemy, that enemy deals 5% less damage to you for 9 seconds.
- There is no good reason for Impending Victory to be on this row (or a talent at all really). It's uses are so niche, *especially* when it's up against two talents that are both damage and survivability increases.

Likely the choice between ITTF and Punish will come down to whether or not you're able to keep near 100% uptime on ITTF. Or it may be as simple as ITTF for AoE and Punish for ST. Punish also has some increased value on magic damage heavy fights. Regardless, both talents are good and I can see situations where you'd take either.

<h3>30 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=203201/crackling-thunder" rel="spell=203201" data-wh-icon-size="small">Crackling Thunder</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202163/bounding-stride" rel="spell=202163" data-wh-icon-size="small">Bounding Stride</a> / <a href="bfa.wowhead.com/spell=223657/safeguard" rel="spell=223657" data-wh-icon-size="small">Safeguard</a></h3>

Not too much to say about this row. It's all utility. None of them are blatantly better than the other two. Overall it's a good row with good choices.

<h3>45 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202560/best-served-cold" rel="spell=202560" data-wh-icon-size="small">Best Served Cold</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275336/unstoppable-force" rel="spell=275336" data-wh-icon-size="small">Unstoppable Force</a> / N/A</h3>

- Best Served Cold is the same as it was. 5% increased damage on Revenge per target, up to 5 targets (25%).
- Unstoppable Force is actually quite fun. The constant [Thunder Claps](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6343/thunder-clap) make it really enjoyable to use. It's also a survivability increase since you'll be getting more [Shield Slam](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam) resets.
- The third talent here is the only left that's not implemented yet.

This row is a bit puzzling. Firstly, with the amount of rage generation we have now, constantly casting [Revenge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge) isn't feasible, so Best Served Cold will really only be good on sustained, heavy AoE where you're constantly getting [Revenge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge) resets. Not only is Unstoppable Force more consistent in its strength, but its a survivability increase, where Best Served Cold is not. There are very few situations where you'd take BSC over UF.

<h3>60 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202095/indomitable" rel="spell=202095" data-wh-icon-size="small">Indomitable</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202561/never-surrender" rel="spell=202561" data-wh-icon-size="small">Never Surrender</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275337/bolster" rel="spell=275337" data-wh-icon-size="small">Bolster</a></h3>

- Indomitable is down to a 10% health increase. It's not *bad*, but it will likely only ever be used in situations where you need the raw HP to survive, or if the other two talents in the row are worthless.
- Speaking of worthless, Never Surrender has returned and it's still terrible. As far as I can tell, it works the same way as old Never Surrender. That is, you need to be at basically 0% HP to get the full 30% out of it. You'll get minimal benefit out of this talent 99% of the time, and in those cases you're better off picking something else. In fact, I would say old Never Surrender was better because you were guaranteed an increase to your Ignore Pain, this just increases block *chance*.
- Bolster is a simple strength -> armor conversion. I can understand why they wouldn't make this baseline. We already have a passive strength to armor conversion. However, when you compare Bolster with the other two choices, there's no compelling reason to pick anything but Bolster.

I would like to see Never Surrender removed and replaced with something that can compete with Bolster. That way you still have Indom for those who want something worse but passive, and then the other two can be used for different situations/playstyles.

As it is though, Bolster has a potential issue where there is barely enough rage to actually cast it. More on that below.

<h3>75 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275338/menace" rel="spell=275338" data-wh-icon-size="small">Menace</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275339/rumbling-earth" rel="spell=275339" data-wh-icon-size="small">Rumbling Earth</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107570/storm-bolt" rel="spell=107570" data-wh-icon-size="small">Storm Bolt</a></h3>

Another utility tier. I really like this row as well. Improve your [Intimidating Shout](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=5246/intimidating-shout), improve your [Shockwave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave), or grab a single target stun. There's good choice here.

<h3>90 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202743/booming-voice" rel="spell=202743" data-wh-icon-size="small">Booming Voice</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202572/vengeance" rel="spell=202572" data-wh-icon-size="small">Vengeance</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=236279/devastator" rel="spell=236279" data-wh-icon-size="small">Devastator</a></h3>

- Booming Voice is slightly nerfed from live, but functions the same.
- Vengeance is in an "interesting" spot. It's now a rotation between [Shield Block](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=231847/shield-block) and [Revenge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge). Because of how little rage is generated and how long Shield Block's cooldown is, and because you'd be spending rage on [Bolster](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275337/bolster) for example, you actually can rotate between the two fairly well without having to double cast either too much. However, you spend so much rage trying to keep up the Vengeance rotation, that you have essentially no rage left for [Bolster](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275337/bolster). Again, more on that below.
- On live, Devastator only "works" because of the insane amounts of rage we generate, so we're able to fill what would be empty GCDs with [Revenges](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge). That way you get Devastator casts on top of everything else, leading to more [Shield Slam](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam) procs, etc. In BfA, at least on single target, Devastator is both a DPS and survivability loss. You have times where you'll go 3-4 seconds without casting anything. There are so many spaces where you can cast [Devastate](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=20243/devastate), that not taking Devastator is better. *However*, AoE is a different story. On AoE, not only are you getting more [Revenge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge) procs, but you're also getting a *lot* more rage. This allows you to fill most of your GCDs and gain the benefit of Devastator.

<h3>100 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management" rel="spell=152278" data-wh-icon-size="small">Anger Management</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=203177/heavy-repercussions" rel="spell=202572" data-wh-icon-size="small">Heavy Repercussions</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=228920/ravager" rel="spell=228920" data-wh-icon-size="small">Ravager</a></h3>

This row is pretty much exactly the same as it is on live. Due to how rage generation is though, AM has greatly reduced value. HR will likely be the go-to choice. You'd likely only take AM when you *need* the CDR.

And then there's Ravager. It needs to be removed/reworked. Why would you *ever* take parry chance over more CDs or increased Shield Block uptime. It's just not reliable.

# Feedback / Suggestions

## Fix rage generation

The difference between rage generation on single target vs. AoE is *massive*. In heavy AoE, you're drowning in rage and you generally cannot spend it fast enough to not cap. This is due to gaining rage from getting meleed. On single-target, rage generation is low, making gameplay frustrating. I would like to see the ICD on rage from getting meleed increase to ~2 seconds and the actual rage gained increased. That way there is much less of a difference in rage generation on ST vs. AoE.

### Shield Block

To go along with the above point, Shield Block costs far too much rage. Trying to keep Shield Block up leaves no rage for anything else. If Shield Block's cost was reduced to say, 20 or 25, this would fix a few issues.

Firstly, even without Vengeance or Devastator, on single target spending rage on Shield Block leaves you with barely any rage for anything else. With Vengeance, you'd be able to keep up the Vengeance rotation while also having some available rage for Bolster. It would be a similar story with Devastator. Devastator works just fine on AoE. Having more rage would go a long way to making Devastator feel better on single target.

### To sum it up:

- The utility we gained is great and it finally feels like we have some actual tools in our toolkit. Having Avatar as our baseline damage cooldown feels awesome from both a gameplay and spec fantasy point of view.
- The talent changes are definitely a step in the right direction.
  - I would like to see Impending Victory replaced with something more compelling. Perhaps some kind of reliable self-heal as we are lacking one at the moment.
  - The "utility rows" (30 and 75) offer good choice. No real complaints there.
  - There's no real choice when it comes to Best Served Cold vs. Unstoppable Force. Unstoppable Force is simply better in the vast majority of situations. I really like UF, so adding some kind of survivability component to BSC would be nice.
  - Never Surrender is in the same, if not worse, position that it was in Legion. No one is going to take a talent that's only strong when you're close to dying. It's generally weak, and it's definitely not fun or interesting in my opinion.
  - Vengeance and Devastator would work much better and more consistently if rage generation was tweaked.
  - Ravager is still in the same position. The consistency of AM and HR are superior to Ravager in almost all situations. I would like to see something in Ravager's place.
- The difference in rage generation on single target vs. AoE is far to extreme.
  - The rage gained from getting meleed should have a ~2 second or so ICD so the difference between ST and AoE isn't so drastic.
  - I would like to see overall rage gen slightly increased. Right now, you feel rage starved in single target and it's quite frustrating.
- Going along with the above, Shield Block's rage cost should be reduced. Spending rage on it leaves you barely any rage for anything else. From a gameplay perspective it's not particularly fun.

All in all, Prot is looking good, it just needs some tweaks here and there to turn it into a truly great spec.
