While many specs are staying more or less the same going into Battle for Azeroth, Protection Warrior is once again getting some fairly significant changes. This is by no means a bad thing. While Prot was fun in Legion, it definitely had its share of issues. In BfA, our core gameplay, i.e. [Devastate](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=20243/devastate)/[Shield Slam](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam)/[Thunder Clap](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6343/thunder-clap)/[Revenge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge), remains more or less the same. The major changes are to our rage generation model, talents, and baseline abilities.

This post will be updated as new changes are released.

# Baseline

## What's being removed

- Of course, our [Artifact](http://wowhead.com/item=128289/scale-of-the-earth-warder) and everything that comes with it
- [Ignore Pain](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain) - At the moment, there is nothing that is baseline that replaces Ignore Pain
- [Battle Cry](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry) - Replaced with [Avatar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar)
- Rage Generation - RFDT (Rage from Damage Taken) has been removed. More on this below.

There are a *lot* of talent changes as well. Those are covered below.

## What's being added

- [Avatar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar) - This is now our baseline damage cooldown and it also generates 20 rage
- [Battle Shout](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6673/battle-shout)
- [Intimidating Shout](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=5246/intimidating-shout)
- [Rallying Cry](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=97462/rallying-cry)
- [Shockwave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave) - Shockwave is now baseline. The cooldown reduction when you hit 3+ targets has been moved to a talent.
- [Defensive Stance](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=71/defensive-stance) - The 30% stamina increase is nothing new. We've had that for at least the last two expansions, it was just a hidden passive. The strength -> armor conversion *is* new though.

## What's being changed

I am ignoring any damage/tuning changes, any rage generation/cost changes, and any changes due to the loss of the artifact.

- [Demoralizing Shout](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1160/demoralizing-shout) - Now on a 45 second cooldown.
- [Shield Block](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=2565/shield-block) - Recharge time changed to 18 seconds. It still has 2 charges. Rage cost increased to 40. I'm mentioning this because it has a fairly large impact on gameplay (more on that below).
- [Spell Reflection](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23920/spell-reflection) - Now reduces magic damage by 15%.
- [Thunder Clap](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6343/thunder-clap) - The slow is now 20% instead of 50%.

## Rage Generation

We no longer gain rage based on the damage we take. There are two sources of rage besides what we gain from abilities:

1. We gain 2 rage from *our* auto attacks.
2. We gain 3 rage from enemy auto attacks.

We do not gain rage from avoidance events (i.e. if the enemy parries/dodges or if we parry/dodge).<br>Firstly, this means that rage generation will likely be more or less consistent throughout the expansion. If things scale as they should, this won't really be an issue (yeah, that's a big "if"). However, because we gain 3 rage when we get meleed, and because there is no ICD (or it is extremely short), the rage generation when tanking one target compared to tanking multiple targets is massive.

On single-target, you generally feel a bit rage starved. When tanking 4+ targets that melee you, you usually quite literally cannot spend your rage fast enough to not cap, particularly because you're getting many more free [Revenges](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge).

# Talents

The most significant changes are to our talents. Rather than list out all of the changes, I'll just go over how they are right now on Beta.<br><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/protection">Beta Talent Calculator</a>
