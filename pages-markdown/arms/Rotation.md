##Rotations:

In patch 7.3 there are several “viable” builds for Arms, mostly depending on your gear (tier bonuses mainly) 

I will try to be as clear as possible in this section, misunderstandings are easy, so please make sure you read it twice. If you have any questions, or need any clarifications on wording here, don’t hesitate to either ask in Skyhold or messaging me on Discord. 

**Please make sure you’ve read the talent section before looking at this section. **

The Rend build excels in a majority of the Tomb of Sargeras fights, and is probably the best talent setup for you if you have tier 20 4p. Which talent build, and tier combination, you should use depends highly on your gear - so it is recommended to always sim yourself. 

The Trauma/FoB build will probably excel on a lot of  Antorus fights, because of the FoB and tier 21 bonus synergies. Keep in mind that FoB is a singletarget talent, as it only increases damage to the main target. It is also difficult to test on dummies if you play this with Opportunity Strikes, as OpS’ chance to proc is linear based on health, from 0% at 100% health to 60% at 1 health. FoB is a good talent for outside world content/questing. It does not offer the same quality of life that Titanic Might has, in terms of 100% CS uptime. 

###CD rotation & Opener

As always, you start the fight with Charge.

- Colossus Smash

This is to put your main reset ability on cooldown, and as Rend costs rage, it might reset it with Tactician.

- Rend

If you have it talented

- Battle Cry 

If you have tier 20 4p, this depends on if you have Bladestorm or Ravager. With Bladestorm, you should use it macroed with Battle Cry. With Ravager, you should use BC roughly half a GCD after Ravager and then continue your standard rotation.
Without 4p you would ideally get a SD buff, macro BC with Mortal Strike, and continue your standard rotation. 



###Standard Rotation/Priority List:

1. Colossus Smash if no Shattered Defenses buff
2. Rend if not applied (and talented)
3. Execute if Ayala’s Stone Heart proc
4. Mortal Strike if SD buff
5. Mortal Strike if zero Executioner’s Precision debuffs
6. Overpower if talented
7. Rend if <2.4s remaining on debuff
8. Cleave (if you have FoB talented, and don’t have Archavon’s Heavy Hand equipped)
9. Slam (Or Whirlwind if FoB talented)

Basically, you maintain Rend (if talented) while prioritizing using CS and consuming your SDs. Unless you have Executioner’s Precision debuffs (which you save for next SD), you use MS on cooldown. 
Using Cleave singletarget without Archavon’s Heavy Hand is for the rage efficiency - FoB build struggles with rage and using Cleave helps negate that a bit. It is a minor gain. 



###Execute Rotation/Priority List: 

1. Mortal Strike if you have x2 Executioner’s Precision and Shattered Defenses
2. Colossus Smash if no SD
3. Overpower if talented, and not going to ragecap
4. Execute

Keep in mind that you still use Rend before Battle Cries even in Execute. You don’t maintain it outside of that. If you do have Fervor of Battle talented, and tier 21 4p you can drop the stacks with a Whirlwind in Execute, however it’s seems to only be a gain if you have 3 Many Will Fall relics. 

###AoE Rotation:

There are a million factors to consider in an aoe situation for Arms. The basics here is, do you go for sustained aoe or burst aoe? For sustained damage, you would ideally look at Damage Per Rage (DPR), while for burst you look for the highest damage output. There’s also things to consider like SS, how many targets got CS, EP, what legendaries do you have equipped and so on. There’s no rotation that is correct in every aoe situation. 

- Basically, you can use Cleave before Whirlwinds on 2 or more targets while still prioritizing CS/MS.
- On 8+ targets you should prioritize Cleave/WW over standard rotation.
- Keep in mind that a Cleave/WW rotation is hard to sustain (in terms of rage) so you will most likely still be filling globals with CS/MS.



###Ravager / Bladestorm use

Perfecting your Rav/BS usage is vital to maximizing your damage output. With t20 4p, it’s quite simple on ST to just line them up with eachother. On AoE you might have to delay it at times though. I recommend looking at logs and practicing when to use it.



###Tips & Tricks:

* Use WB on the GCD before an MS comes off cooldown if you don’t have SD.
* WB procs IftK so you can use it to keep the buff up. 
* Run out and Charge back in when MS and CS are on cooldown, you have low rage, and you've just swung (Get a swing timer WeakAura or use Quartz).
