#Gems/Enchants/Consumables:

###Gems:

Use  [Masterful Argulite]

A [Saber’s Eye of Strength] (+200 Strength) Gem might be worth (note: probably isn’t) but it depends entirely on your gear. You’ll have to sim your char twice (once with mastery gem, once with strength gem) to figure out if it is worth it for you. (This usually ISN’T worth at high ilvls)



## Enchants:

**Cloak** - [Enchant Cloak - Binding of Strength]

**Rings** - [Enchant Ring - Binding of Mastery]

**Neck** - [Enchant Neck - Mark of the Trained Soldier]

All neck enchants are reasonably close. Trained Soldier is the recommended choice due to the aoe gain aswell. 



### Consumables:

**Flask** - [Flask of Countless Armies]
**Food** - [Nightborne Delicacy Platter]  is the recommended food for ST. The difference between foods is rather insignificant though, and [Lavish Suramar Feast] benefits a bit from aoe if it’s consistent enough that you won’t have CS up for all of it. Keep in mind the below sim is with T21 and 971 gear, so results might vary depending on your own gear!



**Potion** - [Potion of the Old War] is the best choice for maximizing ST. Using Prolonged Power in execute, especially with Trauma build, is quite good. Prolonged Power is also the go-to pot for cleave/AoE situations.
