##Stats

###Stat Priority:

Stat priorities vary a lot depending on your gear. The only “cap” you need as arms is 20% (10% with IftK) to fit the whole BS in BC. The rest of the stats are incredibly close, with Mastery usually ahead. You should also note that haste effects like IftK are multipliers, and not a flat +10% haste. That means they increase haste by (1.x * 1.1) where x is your current haste %. I’m only stating 10% with IftK to have some margin of error (latency delays and general human errors)

**A general stat priority is:**
Mastery > Haste (to 9.1-10%)  > Versatility = Haste = Critical Strike > Strength

Stats are very dynamic depending on gear, talents, relics etc, so you should always sim for yourself if you want stat weights/priorities! This is just a rough guideline. 
It is advisable that you always sim yourself as stat priorities change depending on your gear, talents, etc. If you are unsure of simming stat weights, I would recommend using Raidbots to do so.  

###Haste Breakpoints

Arms has a fair amount of haste breakpoints that will show up when you’re simming for stat weights. The “major” one is 20% (+ a bit to account for human error and latency). This is both for reduced BS/Ravager duration, as it is decreased by haste. At 20% the duration is 5 seconds. This means you can fit the whole BS into a BC. 20% haste also reduces your global cooldown so you can fit 5 gcds into one BC. 

**Some Arms breakpoints are as follows:**

* 9.1% - the 20% breakpoint with In for the Kill talent


* 12.5% - Extra gcd in the CS debuff
* 20% - Extra gcd in BC and BS duration decreased to 5 seconds. 


Keep in mind there are some more, although smaller, breakpoints than these.
Haste is still a very good stat outside of breakpoints!
