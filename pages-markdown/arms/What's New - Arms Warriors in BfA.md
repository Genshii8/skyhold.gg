Arms has had a decently sized rework in BfA. However, the rotation should feel similar to Legion's, with it being much less reliant on resets and the [Colossus Smash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash) debuff. 

Most of the issues from Legion are gone, however there are a few newer ones that are not as impactful as not having the [Colossus Smash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash) debuff up however.

A few Artifact traits have been carried over. Some keep their old name, or they were baked into another ability.

<br>
<br>
- [Overpower](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=7384/overpower) is now baseline. It now increases the damage of your next [Mortal Strike](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12294/mortal-strike) by 20%, stacking up to 2 times (think of [Shattered Defenses](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248580/shattered-defenses)).

<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

# Talents

### There have been some significant changes to Arms talents. 

<h3>15 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262231/war-machine" rel="spell=262231" data-wh-icon-size="small">War Machine</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=29725/sudden-death" rel="spell=29725" data-wh-icon-size="small">Sudden Death</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=260643/skullsplitter" rel="spell=260643" data-wh-icon-size="small">Skullsplitter</a></h3>

- [War Machine](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262231/war-machine) is powerful if there's a lot of adds that die quickly. However this isn't always the case. Great for outdoor content with the movement speed.
<br>
<br>
- [Sudden Death](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=29725/sudden-death) is the best choice for single target and cleave situations. I can even see it being used over [War Machine](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262231/war-machine) in M+. [Sudden Death](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=29725/sudden-death) has such a high PPM (2.5), and applies [Deep Wounds](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262111/mastery-deep-wounds) AND [Executioner's Precision](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=272867/executioners-precision) if you have the Azerite trait. [Sudden Death](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=29725/sudden-death), like [Ayala's Stone Heart](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137052/ayalas-stone-heart), has so much damage loaded into it.
<br>
<br>
- [Skullsplitter](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=260643/skullsplitter) seems a little weak in my opinion. It doesn't hit really hard and the rage you gain from it isn't a whole lot. I can see it being used when you need on-demand rage/burst on a target.

<h3>30 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time" rel="spell=103827" data-wh-icon-size="small">Double Time</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory" rel="spell=202168" data-wh-icon-size="small">Impending Victory</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107570/storm-bolt" rel="spell=107570" data-wh-icon-size="small">Storm Bolt</a></h3>

- [Double Time](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time) is an essential talent for Arms for rage generation.
<br>
<br>
- [Impending Victory](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory) was added in place of [Shockwave](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave).
<br>
<br>
- [Stormbolt](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107570/storm-bolt) might seem to be the obvious choice for M+. However, a lot of mobs in dungeons are immune to CC as I've seen in the Beta. And there are better AoE stuns on other specs.

<h3>45 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215538/trauma" rel="spell=215538" data-wh-icon-size="small">Trauma</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=772/rend" rel="spell=772" data-wh-icon-size="small">Rend</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar" rel="spell=107574" data-wh-icon-size="small">Avatar</a></h3>

- [Trauma](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215538/trauma) remains the same, but is really powerful with the new [Fervor of Battle.](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202316/fervor-of-battle)
<br>
<br>
- [Rend](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=772/rend) being a 12s duration is a nice QoL buff. You don't need to refresh it during the new [Colossus Smash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash) window and you spend less rage refreshing it.
<br>
<br>
-  [Avatar](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar) is basically the same, 20 rage every 1.5m is quite weak however.

<h3>60 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=29838/second-wind" rel="spell=29838" data-wh-icon-size="small">Second Wind</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202163/bounding-stride" rel="spell=202163" data-wh-icon-size="small">Bounding Stride</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=197690/defensive-stance" rel="spell=197690" data-wh-icon-size="small">Defensive Stance</a></h3>

- No changes.

<h3>75 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=268243/collateral-damage" rel="spell=268243" data-wh-icon-size="small">Collateral Damage</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262161/warbreaker" rel="spell=262161" data-wh-icon-size="small">Warbreaker</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=845/cleave" rel="spell=845" data-wh-icon-size="small">Cleave</a></h3>

- This entire row is all AoE/Cleave based.
<br>
<br>
- [Collateral Damage](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=268243/collateral-damage) is a little weak and boring. Only really good on consistent 2 target cleave.
<br>
<br>
- [Warbreaker](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262161/warbreaker) of course still a really good AoE burst ability. Can't be parried, really good choice for single target.
<br>
<br>
- However [Cleave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=845/cleave) steals the show,  [Deep Wounds](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262111/mastery-deep-wounds) is really powerful on AoE. Applying it to 3+ targets every 6s is really strong. [Deep Wounds](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262111/mastery-deep-wounds) can end up being 40%+ of your damage on AoE.

<h3>90 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=248621/in-for-the-kill" rel="spell=248621" data-wh-icon-size="small">In for the Kill</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202316/fervor-of-battle" rel="spell=202316" data-wh-icon-size="small">Fervor of Battle</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262228/deadly-calm" rel="spell=262228" data-wh-icon-size="small">Deadly Calm</a></h3>

- Unfortunately this talent row only has one good choice.
<br>
<br>
- [In for the Kill](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=248621/in-for-the-kill) is much weaker now because it doesn't nearly have the same amount of uptime as it does on live.
<br>
<br>
- [Deadly Calm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262228/deadly-calm) feels really bad to press.
<br>
<br>
- And [Fervor of Battle](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202316/fervor-of-battle) is just plain strong. It's amazing on single target and AoE. And all that damage rolls into [Trauma](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=215538/trauma), which is huge.

<h3>100 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management" rel="spell=152278" data-wh-icon-size="small">Anger Management</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262150/dreadnaught" rel="spell=262150" data-wh-icon-size="small">Dreadnaught</a> / <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=152277/ravager" rel="spell=152277" data-wh-icon-size="small">Ravager</a></h3>

- This row has a lot of good choices here.
<br>
<br>
- [Anger Management](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management) is quite powerful, getting more [Colossus Smash's](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash) off and more [Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm).
<br>
<br>
- [Dreadnaught](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262150/dreadnaught) is really fun to play and offers a more frontloaded [Mortal Strike](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12294/mortal-strike) gameplay style. Although a little weaker than [Anger Management](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management), it may have a place in BfA.
<br>
<br>
- [Ravager](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=152277/ravager) remains the same but applies [Deep Wounds](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=262111/mastery-deep-wounds) as mentioned earlier. However, since [Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm) hits very hard as well now, [Ravager](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=152277/ravager)/[Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm) choice might be dependent on the fight timers.

# Azerite Traits (many values are placeholder)

- [Executioner's Precision](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=272867/executioners-precision) - [Execute](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=163201/execute) increases the damage of your next [Mortal Strike](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12294/mortal-strike) against the target by 235, stacking up to 2 times. (Previous Artifact trait)
<br>
<br>
- [Gathering Storm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=273414/gathering-storm) - While [Ravager](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=152277/ravager) is active or you are [Bladestorming](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm) , every 1 sec you gain 22 Speed and [Ravager's](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=152277/ravager)/[Bladestorm's](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm) damage increases by 125. Lasts 6 sec. ([Legendary Helm](http://www.wowhead.com/item=151823/the-great-storms-eye))
<br>
<br>
- [Test of Might](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275529/test-of-might) - When [Colossus Smash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash) expires, your Strength is increased by 9 for every 10 Rage you spent during [Colossus Smash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash). Lasts 12 sec.

#Overview

## Core gameplay

Like mentioned at the beginning, Arms in BfA feels very similar to Arms in Legion. [Colossus Smash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash) being our cooldown is the best thing they could've done for the ability. Not relying on a debuff to deal any sort of damage feels so much better. Target switching is easier, more consistent damage and less frustrating when you go quite a while without procs. Having the [Colossus Smash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash) debuff be a 100% uptime with [Titanic Might](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202612/titanic-might) made it pretty boring, it was quite the band-aid talent. [Shattered Defenses](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248580/shattered-defenses) was moved into [Overpower](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=7384/overpower), increases [Mortal Strike](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12294/mortal-strike) damage, free to cast and resets through [Tactician](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184783/tactician). But it's nearly not as impactful. The rotation is a bit slower, especially with [Fervor of Battle](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202316/fervor-of-battle).

You get less rage per auto, [Opportunity Strikes](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=203179/opportunity-strikes) is gone, [Archavon's Heavy Hand](http://www.wowhead.com/item=137060/archavons-heavy-hand) is gone, [Dauntless](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202297/dauntless) is gone and [Mortal Strike](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12294/mortal-strike) costs 10 more rage. You're going to be spending more time sitting on a GCD or two to keep on CD. 

But there are ways to combat this such as [Charge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=100/charge) and [Bladestorming](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm). However, the higher [Tactician](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=184783/tactician) proc chance helps fill globals.

[Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm) is really powerful now and might be used on single target for its full duration, but we'll have to see.

[Execute](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=163201/execute) phase is pretty simple. 

Spam [Execute](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=163201/execute), use [Overpower](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=7384/overpower) when it procs and [Mortal Strike](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=12294/mortal-strike) at 1-2 [Overpower](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=7384/overpower) stacks depending on talents/traits.

##THIS IS STILL BETA, EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

### To sum it up

- Reliance on [Colossus Smash](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash) is gone.
<br>
<br>
- [Overpower](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=7384/overpower) replaces [Shattered Defenses](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248580/shattered-defenses).
<br>
<br>
- Resets are still in the spec, not nearly as impactful.
<br>
<br>
- Slightly slower rotation without many rage generating/reduction tools.
<br>
<br>
- [Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm) may be worth using for it's full duration on single target.
<br>
<br>
- [Execute](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=163201/execute) phase is largely the same, using Mortal Strike at X [Overpower](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=7384/overpower) stacks/X [Executioner's Precision](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=272867/executioners-precision) Stacks.

### Toolkit compared to Fury

Arms has the upper hand in pretty much every single situation over Fury. [Sweeping Strikes](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=260708/sweeping-strikes) covering 2 target cleave, 3-5 target cleave while talented into [Cleave](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=845/cleave), and Burst AoE with [Bladestorm](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=227847/bladestorm)/[Ravager](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=152277/ravager). Arms really excels at multi-target situations and does decently well at single target.
