# Talents

First off, I have decided to cut down on the talent tier explaining. If you’re looking for basic explaining of what different talents do, I would recommend checking out either the Wowhead or the Icy-Veins talent sections. 

Arms has a fair amount of talent variations in 7.3.2, and what build you can and should run might vary depending on your current gear, and which content you are doing. There’s several resources available to help you figure out what is the optimal way to do things. If you’re looking for raid or fight specific talents, I would either recommend using Warcraftlogs to check top logs and to check out Mgll’s Antorus Cheat Sheet. (Please keep in mind that boss strategies, raid setups, and gear might impact certain choices)

To start with, Arms has a lot of different builds for different situations. Even if you pick a m+ build, those talents might change depending on which dungeon you’re doing and what affixes you have. As such, it’s quite difficult to make a build that is correct 100% of the time. 



## Talent Build Cheat Sheets:

### **Example Mythic+ Build**

Stick with Double Time unless your group wants/needs Shockwave. As such, Shockwave is recommended for a few affixes (such as necrotic), or if you are doing higher keys.
Bounding Stride is an all around good mobility talent, however if you are doing high keys you should consider Defensive Stance. Arms is a bit lacking in the defensives department, and this talent solves that. Keep in mind that both Avatar and Trauma work. Avatar is a bit more controlled, and therefore helps you more on the hard packs where you need the extra burst. 

As you get tier 21 - it might be beneficial to go Fervor/Trauma over Titanic Might. This will likely depend on which dungeon, what level and which affixes you are doing. There will be more information on this when we get to test the tier set in different mythic+s. 



###**Example Single Target Build with T20**

This is just an example of a decent ST build. You might benefit more from going Trauma/Fervor of Battle, or from going Ravager. This all depends on YOUR GEAR. In ToS, Rend excels on 1-2 targets and Titanic Might really helps with the frustrating tactician rng arms experience. 

As tier 20 and CoF being nerfed after heroic week, the combination of CoF/Ravager on singletarget is pretty dead. 



### **Example Single Target Build with T21**

Tier 21 bonuses synergize extremely well with Trauma and Fervor of Battle. Picking FoB means Whirlwind replaces Slam as your general filler ability. 

Trauma is a must-pick when you have Fervor of Battle. 



###**Example Cleave/AoE Build**

Sweeping Strikes is an excellent talent in any cleave situation, and as such it is great in ToS and M+. Titanic Might is excellent in combination with Warbreaker or Weight of the Earth for AoE, or cleave if you spread your CS. 

Trauma is the clear, consistent aoe pick, while Avatar is amazing for the burst AoE. Rend can be very competitive on 2 target cleave. I’ll go more into the choice of Trauma vs Rend vs Avatar further down. 



## Notable Talents

**Trauma | Rend | Avatar**

This is probably the row of talents you’ll swap around the most. Rend is a very good choice for a lot of the ToS fights, but it does fall behind in mythic+. You can possibly make it work in dungeons with a lot of bosses, and not a lot of trash (For example Upper Karazhan) on tyrannical weeks. The rage cost and short duration of Rend makes it difficult to keep up on more than 2 targets. 

Avatar is a good choice for the mythic+ dungeons though. It offers more on-demand controllable burst than Trauma. As such it can really help you on the hard packs as an additional cooldown, or on the hard bosses as a cooldown combination with Bloodlust. It also synergizes well with some on-use aoe trinkets like Umbral Moonglaives from Sisters. 

Trauma is also a very good choice in general. It’s strong in most situations - like consistent aoe, single target when you have t21 4p and FoB etc. 



**Fervor of Battle | Titanic Might**

The biggest misinterpretation here is that FoB is an aoe talent, however it ONLY increases damage done to your main target. As such, it’s a single target dps increase, and makes you replace Slam in your standard rotation with Whirlwind. It has decent synergy with Trauma also. It is an excellent choice for when you have tier 21 4p - though some fights or mythic+ might benefit more from TM.

Titanic Might is an incredibly strong talent for cleave and aoe sitations, and it offers great quality of life improvements on single target. It decreases CS cooldown and increases duration, which means you get a 100% uptime on CS on 1 target. It also means you get an increased uptime on AoE from sources like Warbreaker or Weight of the Earth. 



**In For The Kill | Focused Rage**

The default choice here is always IftK. The 10% haste buff is a multiplier (like almost every haste buff) which means you gain 1.X*1.1 haste, where X is your haste. For example, if I have 15% haste, I’d get 1.15*1.1=1.265 which means I’d have 26.5% haste with the buff. The main thing with haste is getting enough to fit your whole Bladestorm or Ravager in your Battle Cry windows. To achieve that, you’ll need 20% haste (to reduce the duration), which means you’ll at the least want 9.1% haste. (This is all assuming t20 4p)

Focused Rage also has its moments, which is mainly when you require high on-demand burst. In ToS, that is mainly used on Mythic Kil’Jaeden for the add damage burst. If you do look at logs however, this is not needed, but it is a good option if your raid composition requires it. For Antorus - Focused Rage is likely dead. It’s an extremely situational talent and while it can shine in a few (and do quite well in others) it tends to be the worse option.



**Ravager | Opportunity Strikes**

Opportunity Strikes is the better choice once you get tier 21 4p bonus. It’s a passive talent that scales with targets health (higher chance to proc the lower health your target is), and requires almost no thought. The extra rage gain in execute phase helps smoothen out the rotation too. 

Ravager used to be an extremely strong talent with tier 20 bonuses, Convergence of Fates (Trinket from Elisande) and legendary head - The Great Storm’s Eye.  The 2p bonus reduces your Bladestorm (or Ravager) cooldown when you use CS, and CoF has a chance to reduce Battle Cry cooldown. Combining these things means you can line up BC/Ravager. Another thing with Ravager is that you can make your SD affect two Mortal Strikes by casting it within ~0.5s of the 4p casted one. You can do this by using Ravager first and then popping BC -> MS roughly half a global cooldown later. Ravager (and potentially tier 20) can be strong choices in aoe situations aswell. Ravager is still a decent choice for m+, as the cooldown lines up with Warbreaker when you switch to T21.
