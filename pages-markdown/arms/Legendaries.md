#Legendaries:

Which legendaries are best for you specifically will depend on your offpieces. This is why there won’t be a sim list of legendaries, however there will be a tl;dr overview at the end. Please sim your own character for your own needs.

**[Archavon’s Heavy Hand]**
One of the best legendaries you can get. It is great with tier 21 bonuses - as the rage cost to keep up a Fervor of Battle rotation is a tad high. The stats are a bit suboptimal, and it takes a tier spot. However, it helps a lot with rage and the “smoothness” of the rotation. The Rage decrease does not affect Tactician procs, and it is extremely nice in synergy with Sweeping Strikes, as you lose out on the passive Dauntless rage reduction.

**[Ayala’s Stone Heart]**
This is an exceptional legendary. Even with the recent nerf to the proc chance, Ayala’s is still great. It has an extreme amount of synergy with Arms’ traits and talents. Espeically with the Executioner’s Precision golden trait, and to a lesser degree Deathblow. It also works with Tactician, and counts as a 40 rage Execute. Ayala’s also works with Sweeping Strikes, and applies a stack of Executioner’s Precision to all targets it hits. Possibly the best overall use legendary you can hope for.

**[The Great Storm’s Eye]**
The tier 20 bonuses synergizes great with this legendary, as you’re already using Bladestorm/Ravager on ST. Without the t20 set bonus, this will only be good in AoE situations. 

**[Kil’Jaeden’s Burning Wish]**
Solid legendary for Arms, as the damage scales with CS. You can easily combine this with Warbreaker or Weight of the Earth legendary for massive on-demand burst damage. It’s also a decent stat stick trinket, and the on-use damage scales with item level so it does get stronger as they upgrade legendaries. 

**[The Weight of the Earth]**
This is a very decent legendary for AoE situations. Combining it with Titanic Might makes it very strong on prolonged aoe, but the same talent also devalues it on single-target, as you get a 100% uptime on CS already. 

**[Aggramar’s Stride]**
Decent stat stick legendary with a great quality of life bonus with the movement speed. It also turns your BCs into Sprints! Decent legendary, depending on what alternative offpieces you have to wear.

**[Mannoroth’s Bloodletting Manacles]**
This is another decently itemized stat stick with a quality of life effect. It is really good if you take consistent damage, and since you’re always spending rage you’re constantly getting healing from these bracers. Overall a good stat stick with a nice bonus if you need the healing, so similiar to Prydaz for progress.

**[Naj’entus’s Vertebrae]**
Solid choice for constant AoE. It has some decent synergies with Trauma, and it can be strong in situations with a lot of targets with high uptime. The extra hit turns out to be a 33% increase, as WW hits 3 times per target and this legendary increases it to 4 times per target. This is also a good choice on multitarget fights when you have Fervor of Battle talented - for more priority target damage on your main target. 

**[Prydaz, Xavaric’s Magnum Opus]**
Prydaz is a good, overbudget neck, and a decent legendary for Arms. With all stats being relatively close, it is perfectly itemized and might excel on progression fights if you need the extra survivability. As far as numbers go, this is a middle of the pack legendary. It all depends on what alternative offpieces you have to replace it with. 

**[Rethu’s Incessant Courage]**
This legendary is incredibly well itemized, aswell as having 3 sockets for that extra mastery potential.  This is a decent legendary if you’re a fresh 110 with no legendaries (or if you plan on leveling, as you can equip it already at level 101). It's better than most other stat stick legendaries because of its triple sockets. Not too much to say about this other than it's a great stat stick and some okay quality of life effects attached to it.

**[Timeless Stratagem]**
This has some decent stats. The extra 2 leaps are nice for mobility and synergise well with Weight of the Earth legendary for M+. On demand AoE CS’s with 3 charges is a pretty nice quality upgrade. Other than that this is a pretty mediocre legendary, especially as it takes a tier spot. It is nice for mobility during world quests, other world content, or even old raids though. 

**[Sephuz’s Secret]**
The effect on Sephuz is incredibly strong, but it can be hard to proc when it is wanted. The good thing is that the root from Charge procs it, and in a lot of m+ dungeons you can interrupt almost every 30s, so it can be strong for m+ trash if used right. Other than proccing it on cd however, it is rather weak and has some suboptimal stats.

**[Soul of the Battlelord]**
This gives you the talent Deadly Calm, which means you can pick Focused Rage if you wish. This is a bit of a different playstyle. It’s not amazing by any means, but it might have its uses. 

**[Insignia of the Grand Army]**
This new legendary is coming with Antorus release - it’s similar to other stat stick legendaries and might be okay for you. You should sim yourself. It also relies on you having decent netherlight traits.





##TL;DR LEGENDARIES:

###OVERALL GREAT

**[Archavon’s Heavy Hand]**
All around good legendary, fallen from the top with t20, will likely be back in top 2 for tier 21

**[Ayala’s Stone Heart]**
Amazing legendary, even post-nerf. Used in almost every situation.



###SITUATIONALLY GREAT

**[The Great Storm’s Eye]**
Great synergy with t20, good stats and all around decent legendary.

**[Kil’Jaeden’s Burning Wish]**
Affected by CS, so has potential to be amazing for burst aoe. 

**[The Weight of the Earth]**
Strong for on demand CS, especially in AoE situtations. This also procs T21 2p, which makes it potentially excellent in m+.



###SITUATIONALLY OKAY:

**[Aggramar’s Stride]**
Ok stats, ok equip. Works with Battle Cry for sprint.

**[Mannoroth’s Bloodletting Manacles]**
Decent survivability, decent stats. Pretty much another stat stick legendary.

**[Naj’entus’s Vertebrae]**
Okay for constant AoE.

**[Prydaz, Xavaric’s Magnum Opus]**
Great stat stick, great survivability. Strong when the shield is needed, which could either be progress bosses or high m+ keys.

**[Rethu’s Incessant Courage]**
Decent stat stick, but nothing amazing.

**[Timeless Stratagem]**
Decent stat stick again, the use helps with corpse runs or if you run low level content.. Could also be fights in the future where this kind of mobility is useful.

**[Sephuz’s Secret]**
It’s ok if you can reliably get the proc. Procs from Charge root, and as such it’s easy to pop in dungeons. It’s weak in terms of stats.

**[Soul of the Battlelord]**
Gives Deadly Calm, which means you can go back to Focused Rage. Bit of a different playstyle, but not the worst legendary to get. 

**[Insignia of the Grand Army]**
Increases Netherlight Crucible tier 2 bonuses - can be okay, similar to other “stat stick” legendaries. Sim yourself.
