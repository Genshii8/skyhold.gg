###Traits:

After 35 traits, go for 4th golden trait (Executioner’s Precision) as fast as possible, then Precise Strikes/Exploit the Weakness into Deathblow/Crushing Blow before moving into Unending Rage/Many Will Fall/One Against Many. The exact order makes a minimal difference.



### Relics:

Ilvl is good for arms, however there’s a few traits that are sometimes better (Precise Strikes, Exploit the Weakness, Many Will Fall with FoB talented, etc). You should always sim the non-obvious new relics for your own character. I would recommend using Raidbots for this.



###Netherlight Crucible

First off, I recommend using this Crucible Weight addon to get guideline weights for your relics on-the-go without having to sim. You should almost always sim and apply some critical thinking when the choice isn’t obvious. I would also STRONGLY recommend using the Raidbots Relic Tool for simming, it’s an amazing, user-friendly tool.

Before you get tier 21, you’ll probably benefit from the Crucibleweight string in this Netherlight Crucible Spreadsheet
With tier 21, you can use Bloodmallet’s Relic Tool (which has a Crucibleweight string at the bottom).
