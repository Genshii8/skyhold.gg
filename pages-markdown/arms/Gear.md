##Trinkets:

If you’re looking for a quick comparison of trinkets for Arms, I would recommend checking out Bloodmallet’s trinket comparison tool. It’s quite good, but it is obviously highly recommended that you sim things for your own character as gear, legendaries and so on does have an impact. I highly recommend you use Raidbots for this. 

You should keep in mind that some of these trinkets are a bit inflated in Simcraft. For example, Cradle of Anguish has a 100% uptime in sims, that might not be realistic in a real scenario however. Engine of Eradiction assumes you pick up every single orb, which you also might not be able to do. Eye of Command is similar, it’ll drop a lot on any fight with any kind of targetswitching.

As having a Pantheon trinket (Either Aman’thuls Vision or Khaz’goroth’s Courage) is basically a must-have, you won’t have much room for trinkets. If you have questions about these Pantheon trinkets from Argus - I strongly recommend you read Archimtiros’ writeup about it on Wowhead. 



###Tier Bonuses:

I figured it’d be a good idea to have a little write-up to explain the strong and the weak points of our tier sets. This will disregard tier 19 as that was considerably nerfed and has a rather weak 2p. 



**Tier 20 - Titanic Onslaught: **
This bonus made certain talents (Mainly rend, titanic might, ravager) very strong in Tomb of Sargeras. Combined with the pure strength of the 4p (making bladestorm/ravager a strong cd both on ST and aoe) - we also got a new legendary (The Great Storm’s Eye - head piece) in the patch. The synergy between the new legendary and the T20 4p made Arms extremely strong in ToS. It was also a rather innovative bonus, that both felt fun to use and like a new idea.

As of now, the bonus has been significantly nerfed - although it is still strong. Combining the T20 4p and T21 2p (especially until you reach higher gear levels) is rather strong. 



**Tier 21 - Juggernaut: **
Our new tier bonus might seem underwhelming at first glance. It’s not as innovative or “cool” of an idea as the previous tier, but it is really good once you do get higher gear. The main thing to notice is that it’s “crit damage” rather than crit, which synergizes well with Battle Cry. It also makes crit a slightly better stat for us than previously. The 2p bonus also procs from both Warbreaker and Weight of the Earth legendary.

Getting the 4p bonus means you’ll start using Trauma and Fervor of Battle, two not-so-popular talents. FoB tends to highlight the worse parts of Arms (Rage issues, mainly) - that in combination with using one of your AoE abilities as a single-target filler can be frustrating. Fun is a subjective thing though, so there is people who like it, people who don’t mind it and people who hate it, so you’ll have to try for yourself. 

Overall, T21 scales great so it’ll only get better the better your gear is.
