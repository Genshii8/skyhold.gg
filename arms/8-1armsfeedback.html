                        <h1 id="overall">Overall</h1>
                        <p>Currently, Arms is in a very good spot, both in terms of gameplay and it's competitiveness within raids/Mythic+. It has a versatile toolkit that can adapt to many situations, and rarely feels "weak" or like it's lacking something during a particular encounter. Arms gameplay does lack a bit of depth and can be boring at times, but of course that's up to personal preference and is definitely not necessarily a bad thing. Talent variety/choice is lacking; we run the same build for most content. We have some interesting Azerite traits and many have a decent impact on how the spec is played. Overall, Arms is a fun and competitive spec and isn't in need of any significant changes.</p>
                        <h1 id="toolkitgameplay">Toolkit/Gameplay</h1>
                        <p>One of Arms' strengths is our versatile toolkit and ability to adapt to many situations. We have the ability to talent into a strong on-demand defensive via <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197690/defensive-stance">Defensive Stance</a>, a powerful raid cooldown (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=97462/rallying-cry">Rallying Cry</a>), as well as AoE crowd control with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=5246/intimidating-shout">Intimidating Shout</a>. Arms works very well in most competitive PvE content. We have very strong burst AoE, strong single-target, strong cleave/two-target DPS, and a strong execute phase that requires no ramp up.</p>
                        <p>There's not a whole lot of negative things to say about Arms gameplay. It's definitely on the simpler side, and as a result can be a bit boring, but that can also be a positive for some.</p>
                        <h2 id="thevalueandscalingofstrength">The Value and Scaling of Strength</h2>
                        <p>One concern is the direction Strength seems to be heading in regards to how much its valued as item level keeps increasing. Currently, Strength is a "good" stat, but as item level increases, the value of secondary stats increases, and the value of Strength doesn't. Strength has very little interaction with Arms' toolkit/Azerite traits, whereas secondaries do. As such, Strength will get "left behind", and the importance of item level decreases. We'd like to see this addressed so item level in the future still remains important.</p>
                        <h1 id="talents">Talents</h1>
                        <p>Talents are the primary concern for Arms. There is very little variety and choice when it comes to talent builds; the "utility rows" offer good choice, but many talents simply aren't competitive and as such we're locked into a single talent for a given row.</p>

                        <li>Currently <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260643/skullsplitter">Skullsplitter</a> is taken in almost every situation in game due to how much rage it supplies the rotation.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262231/war-machine">War Machine</a> seems like the go to AoE choice, but due to its design, it has a bit of anti-synergy with itself.  Often times you will burst down a bunch of adds and lose much of War Machine’s benefit due to out of combat degen.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=29725/sudden-death">Sudden Death</a> is generally weaker than Skullsplitter without proper support.

                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=103827/double-time">Double Time</a> is a great mobility option and is a minor DPS increase if used properly.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=107570/storm-bolt">Storm Bolt</a> is a powerful stun at a moderate range. It's very useful in Mythic+.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory">Impending Victory</a> replaces <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=34428/victory-rush">Victory Rush</a> and adds a rage cost, making the talent fairly unappealing.</li>

                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=281001/massacre">Massacre</a> is currently the go to option in all content, not only is it a strong option by itself, but many fights in Uldir benefit the execute phase through either elongated phases, damage buffs, or just the fact that the later phases are the toughest. It also has strong synergy with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272866/executioners-precision">Executioner’s Precision</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=202316/fervor-of-battle">Fervor of Battle</a> doesn’t compete on single-target or low target cleave. One redeeming quality is that it spends a lot of rage quite efficiently, so perhaps later on with more secondaries it will have a place.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=772/rend">Rend</a> has a similar problem to Fervor in that it spends a lot of rage that we don’t really have yet, it is also much easier to misplay compared to Massacre.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 id="level60">Level 60</h2>

                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197690/defensive-stance">Defensive Stance</a> is invaluable on progression, an on demand 20% damage reduction with a fairly small opportunity cost is not something you give up easily.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=202163/bounding-stride">Bounding Stride</a> is a strong mobility option, however it doesn’t always get used to full effect.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=29838/second-wind">Second Wind</a> has almost no value in most situations. Generally, it's during leveling or to help your healers out with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/affix=12/grievous">Grievous</a>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=268243/collateral-damage">Collateral Damage</a> is a powerful option for 2 target cleave fights, however it relies on the cooldown of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260708/sweeping-strikes">Sweeping Strikes</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262161/warbreaker">Warbreaker</a> is the most universal option in this row, and the best option for burst AoE.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=845/cleave">Cleave</a> is reserved for sustained AoE or sustained 3 target cleave. Losing the ability to apply <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash">Colossus Smash</a> on 3 targets is often not worth the trade off.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=248621/in-for-the-kill">In for the Kill</a> is the go to option for this row. This talent has great synergy with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management">Anger Management</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275529/test-of-might">Test of Might</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar">Avatar</a> is generally weaker than In For The Kill, however it does provide higher burst potential and can be powerful in Mythic+ if used properly.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262228/deadly-calm">Deadly Calm</a> is currently far too undertuned and has anti-synergy with Anger Management and Test of Might, coupled with the potential for misplay and to waste a lot of rage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 id="level100">Level 100</h2>
                        <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management">Anger Management</a> does a lot of heavy lifting. It has synergy with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=248621/in-for-the-kill">In for the Kill</a> and some minor synergy with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260643/skullsplitter">Skullsplitter</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=281001/massacre">Massacre</a>. It also pairs very well with most of our Azerite traits, especially <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275529/test-of-might">Test of Might</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278752/lord-of-war">Lord of War</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262150/dreadnaught">Dreadnaught</a> offers a smoother rotation, but the DPS is not impressive. Even when we ran <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=277639/seismic-wave">Seismic Wave</a> before the heavy nerfs, Anger Management dominated.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=152277/ravager">Ravager</a> feels very underwhelming right now. Not only does it not compete with Anger Management, but also having a 1 minute cooldown causes it to desyncs itself from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=167105/colossus-smash">Colossus Smash</a>. Possibly changing something so that Ravager is able to align with cooldowns would help its viability.</li>

                        <h1 id="azeritetraits">Azerite Traits</h1>
                        <p>Azerite traits are one of the shining stars for Arms in terms of their design. For the most part they offer powerful and impactful additions that you can truly feel either in the gameplay or rotation. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272866/executioners-precision">Executioner’s Precision</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275529/test-of-might">Test of Might</a> are the true breakouts here in terms of design. Both of these traits not only are very powerful in terms of damage but they each offer their own meaningful change to the rotation that adds a bit of nuance to the spec’s normally fairly straightforward rotation. Traits such as <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278752/lord-of-war">Lord of War</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278751/crushing-assault">Crushing Assault</a>, although not as fancy, still have noticeable gameplay impacts. </p>
                        <p>The only real disappointing trait is <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273409/gathering-storm">Gathering Storm</a>. This trait doesn’t change your rotation at all as all it really offers is damage to a single spell and it isn’t tuned high enough to be good. Thankfully it is already being looked at in the latest PTR build. The build has a change to Gathering Storm that does seem to be for the better as it moves to a design more similar to that of the Legion Arms Legendary Helmet, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=151823/the-great-storms-eye">The Great Storm’s Eye</a>.</p>
