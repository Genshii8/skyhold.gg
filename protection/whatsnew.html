                        <p>While many specs are staying more or less the same going into Battle for Azeroth, Protection Warrior is once again getting some fairly significant changes. This is by no means a bad thing. While Prot was fun in Legion, it definitely had its share of issues. In BfA, our core gameplay, i.e. <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=20243/devastate">Devastate</a>/<a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam">Shield Slam</a>/<a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6343/thunder-clap">Thunder Clap</a>/<a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge">Revenge</a>, remains more or less the same. The major changes are to our rage generation model, talents, and baseline abilities.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Prot Warrior is still incomplete and we will definitely see more changes before BfA is released. Nothing is set in stone.</u></strong></p>
                        <p>This post will be updated as new changes are released.</p>
                        <h1 id="whatsbeingremoved">What's being removed</h1>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Of course, our <a href="http://wowhead.com/item=128289/scale-of-the-earth-warder">Artifact</a> and everything that comes with it.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1719/battle-cry">Battle Cry</a> - Replaced with <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar">Avatar</a>
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li>Rage Generation - RFDT (Rage from Damage Taken) has been removed. More on this below.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are a <em>lot</em> of talent changes as well. Those are covered below.</p>
                        <h1 id="whatsbeingadded">What's being added</h1>
                        <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=107574/avatar">Avatar</a> - This is now our baseline damage cooldown and it also generates 20 rage.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6673/battle-shout">Battle Shout</a>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=97462/rallying-cry">Rallying Cry</a>
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=46968/shockwave">Shockwave</a> - Shockwave is now baseline. The cooldown reduction when you hit 3+ targets has been moved to a talent.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=71/vanguard">Vanguard</a> - The 30% stamina increase is nothing new. We've had that for at least the last two expansions, it was just a hidden passive. The strength -&gt; armor conversion <em>is</em> new though.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h1 id="whatsbeingchanged">What's being changed</h1>
                        <p>I am ignoring any damage/tuning changes, any rage generation/cost changes, and any changes due to the loss of the artifact.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1160/demoralizing-shout">Demoralizing Shout</a> - Now on a 45 second cooldown.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=2565/shield-block">Shield Block</a> - Recharge time changed to 18 seconds. It still has 2 charges. Rage cost increased to 30. I'm mentioning this because it has a fairly large impact on gameplay (more on that below).
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain">Ignore Pain</a> - This Ignore Pain functions in the exact same way, except the AP ratio has been massively nerfed and it now lets 50% of damage through instead of 90%.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23920/spell-reflection">Spell Reflection</a> - Now reduces magic damage by 15%.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6343/thunder-clap">Thunder Clap</a> - The slow is now 20% instead of 50%.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=76857/mastery-critical-block">Mastery: Critical Block</a> - This may sound like just a tooltip change, but with the block rating system in BfA, our Mastery <em>is</em> a bit different. Short explaination below.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h1 id="ragegeneration">Rage Generation</h1>
                        <p>We no longer gain rage based on the damage we take. There are two sources of rage besides what we gain from abilities:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>We gain 2 rage from <em>our</em> auto attacks.</li>
                        <li>We gain 3 rage from enemy auto attacks.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>We do not gain rage from avoidance events (i.e. if the enemy parries/dodges or if we parry/dodge).<br>Firstly, this means that rage generation will likely be more or less consistent throughout the expansion. If things scale as they should, this won't really be an issue (yeah, that's a big "if"). However, because we gain 3 rage when we get meleed, and because there is an extremely short ICD (~0.5s), the difference in rage generation when tanking one target compared to tanking multiple targets is massive.</p>
                        <p>On single-target, you generally feel a bit rage starved. When tanking a significant number of targets that melee you, you usually cannot spend your rage fast enough to not cap, particularly because you're getting many more free <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge">Revenges</a>.</p>
                        <h1 id="mastery">Mastery</h1>
                        <p>Instead of a crit block being simply 60% DR instead of 30%, a crit block in BfA is a block as if you had twice your current block value.</p>
                        <p>Think of block value as armor that is only active when you block. That's why DR from block goes "down" when you get more armor. If you add more armor onto <em>more</em> armor, you're farther up the armor DR curve, making that "block armor" less effective . Blizzard has changed the tooltip from showing just the DR from block to armor + block DR, that way it doesn't feel like block gets weaker if you gain armor. That's also why it may seem like block is overtuned; it's not, it just includes armor.</p>
                        <p>So, if you have 1000 block base, when you crit block it's like you had 2000 block. This is currently quite a bit weaker than the flat 30%/60% blocks on live (ignoring Bastion), however this is more of a tuning issue rather than a design issue.</p>
                        <p>This is how we think it works at least, it hasn't been confirmed.</p>
                        <h1 id="talents">Talents</h1>
                        <p>The most significant changes are to our talents. Rather than list out all of the changes, I'll just go over how they are right now on Beta.<br><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/protection">Beta Talent Calculator</a></p>
                        <h3>15 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202603/into-the-fray" rel="spell=202603" data-wh-icon-size="small">Into the Fray</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275334/punish" rel="spell=275334" data-wh-icon-size="small">Punish</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory" rel="spell=202168" data-wh-icon-size="small">Impending Victory</a></h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202603/into-the-fray">Into the Fray</a> is now useful in <em>many</em> more situations compared to Live. It counts allies as well, making it very easy to keep up the buff at full or close to full stacks.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275334/punish">Punish</a> is also a fairly good talent. It's essentially a permanent 3% DR on single-target (you'd also be able to keep 100% uptime on 2-3 targets with good procs). The debuff is applied to the enemy, not you. In other words, when you <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam">Shield Slam</a> an enemy, that enemy deals 3% less damage to you for 9 seconds.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory">Impending Victory</a> feels very out of place on this row. It is not competitive from damage or survivability standpoint when compared to the other two talents. It's niche use as a reactive heal will <em>rarely</em> turn out to be useful.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Likely the choice between <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202603/into-the-fray">ITF</a> and <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275334/punish">Punish</a> will come down to whether or not you're able to keep near 100% uptime on <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202603/into-the-fray">ITF</a>. Or it may be as simple as <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202603/into-the-fray">ITF</a> for AoE and <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275334/punish">Punish</a> for ST. <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275334/punish">Punish</a> also has some increased value on magic damage heavy fights compared to <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202603/into-the-fray">ITF</a>. Regardless, both talents are good and I can see situations where you'd take either.</p>

                        <p>Not too much to say about this row. It's all utility. None of them are blatantly better than the other two. Overall it's a good row with good choices.</p>
                        <h3>45 - <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202560/best-served-cold" rel="spell=202560" data-wh-icon-size="small">Best Served Cold</a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275336/unstoppable-force" rel="spell=275336" data-wh-icon-size="small">Unstoppable Force</a> / N/A</h3>

                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275336/unstoppable-force">Unstoppable Force</a> is a damage and survivability increase. More <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6343/thunder-clap">Thunder Claps</a> mean more <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam">Shield Slam</a> resets, which means more rage, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br></li>
                        <li>The third talent here is the only one left that's not implemented yet.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This row is a bit puzzling. Firstly, with the amount of rage generation we have now, constantly casting <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge">Revenge</a> isn't feasible, so <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202560/best-served-cold">Best Served Cold</a> will really only be good on sustained, heavy AoE where you're constantly getting <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge">Revenge</a> resets. Not only is <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275336/unstoppable-force">Unstoppable Force</a> more consistent in its strength, but its a survivability increase, where <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202560/best-served-cold">Best Served Cold</a> is not. There are very few situations where you'd take <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202560/best-served-cold">BSC</a> over <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275336/unstoppable-force">UF</a>.</p>

That is, you need to be at basically 0% HP to get the full 30% out of it. You'll get minimal benefit out of this talent the majority of the time, meaning you're much better off picking another, more consistent, talent on this row.

                        <li><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202572/vengeance">Vengeance</a> is in an "interesting" spot. It's really good for rage efficiency in theory, but if you spend all your rage keeping up the <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202572/vengeance">Vengeance</a> rotation, you don't leave a lot of rage to cast your active mitigation abilities. Or, on the flip side, if you're spending rage on keeping up your AM, you won't get much benefit out of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202572/vengeance">Vengeance</a>. It's hard to say right now whether or not this talent is worth taking.

                        <li>On live, <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=236279/devastator">Devastator</a> only "works" because of the insane amount of rage we generate, so we're able to fill what would be empty GCDs with <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge">Revenges</a>. That way you get Devastator casts on top of everything else, leading to more <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=23922/shield-slam">Shield Slam</a> procs, etc. In BfA, at least on single target, <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=236279/devastator">Devastator</a> is both a DPS and survivability loss. You have times where you'll go 3-4 seconds without casting anything. There are so many spaces where you can cast <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=20243/devastate">Devastate</a>, that not taking Devastator is better. <em>However</em>, AoE is a different story. On AoE, not only are you getting more <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge">Revenge</a> procs, but you're also getting a <em>lot</em> more rage. This allows you to fill most of your GCDs and gain the benefit of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=236279/devastator">Devastator</a>.</li>

                        <p>This row is pretty much exactly the same as it is on live. Due to how rage generation is though, <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management">AM</a> has greatly reduced value. <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=203177/heavy-repercussions">HR</a> will likely be the go-to choice. You'd likely only take <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management">AM</a> when you <em>need</em> the CDR.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=228920/ravager">Ravager</a> is still significantly weaker compared to the other two choices on this row. It does not provide a <em>consistent</em> survivability increase, but rather you must rely on the RNG nature of parry. <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=203177/heavy-repercussions">HR</a> and <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=152278/anger-management">AM</a> both provide a consistent, "guaranteed" survivability increase.</p>

                        <h1 id="overviewthoughts">Overview / Thoughts</h1>
                        <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
                        <p>One point of concern is rage generation. The difference between rage generation on single target vs. AoE is <em>massive</em>. In heavy AoE, you gain far too much rage to the point where you can't spend it all. This is due to gaining rage from getting meleed. On single-target, rage generation is low, making it difficult to maintain your rotation.</p>
                        <p>The spec functions more or less the same as Live, but feels a lot slower. Going from Live to BfA takes a bit getting used to, however the core gameplay is still there. It's really a matter of personal preference. Some people will be happy to leave being the spammy nature of Legion Prot, while some will miss it.</p>
                        <h3 id="shieldblock">Shield Block</h3>
                        <p>To go along with the above point about rage, <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=2565/shield-block">Shield Block's</a> rage cost can be inhibiting. Trying to keep <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=2565/shield-block">Shield Block</a> up makes it difficult to cast other abilities that cost rage, to the point where casting, say, <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=6572/revenge">Revenge</a> may lock you out of casting <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=2565/shield-block">Shield Block's</a> for several seconds. You could argue that this is a good gameplay dynamic because you have to make the decision between one ability or the other. I don't necessarily disagree with that. However the decision making can still be there even if rage gen is increased as the result of that is increased rotational fluidity.</p>
                        <h3 id="ignorepain">Ignore Pain</h3>
                        <p>There's not too much to say about <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain">Ignore Pain</a> as it functions in the exact same way as it does on Live. It's just been nerfed to the point where it's not even worth casting if you have <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275337/bolster">Bolster</a>. With rage generation as it is, you essentially keep <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=2565/shield-block">Shield Block</a> up as much as possible, use <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275337/bolster">Bolster</a> when you can for physical damage, and use <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=190456/ignore-pain">Ignore Pain</a> exclusively to mitigate non-physical damage.</p>
                        <h2 id="tosumitup">To sum it up:</h2>
                        <p>We gained quite a lot of utility and our core playstyle remains the same from Legion, albeit it has been slowed down significantly.</p>
                        <p>The talent changes are definitely a step in the right direction. Changes to underperforming talents such as <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202168/impending-victory">Impending Victory</a>, <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=228920/ravager">Ravager</a>, and <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=202561/never-surrender">Never Surrender</a> would go a long way to increase diversity in talent builds.</p>
                        <p>There are of course some talents/abilities that are under/overtuned, but balancing is still ongoing so that's not of much concern right now.</p>
                        <p>Finally, some small tweaks to rage generation would greatly increase the fluidity of the spec and allow it to perform much more consistently between single target and AoE.</p>
                        <p>All in all, Prot is looking good, it just needs some adjustments here and there to turn it into a truly great spec.</p>
