                    <article class="flex-stretch">
                        <p>Protection didn't get off to the greatest start in BfA. Many were unhappy with the hit to Rage generation and the overall (slower) feel of the spec. Not to mention the addition of putting Ignore Pain on the GCD.  But "feels" aside, Protection has been the subject of underutilization in raids/Mythic+, and worst of all, reddit memes. And for (mostly) good reason. Looking <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/17#class=Tanks&dataset=0">at the statistics for Uldir</a> and Antorus, Protection went from making up ~8.5% of tank parses to making up only ~5% of tank parses, a ~40% reduction in the (logged) Protection Warrior playerbase. There are a number of reasons why this is the case. Protection has several pain points when it comes to its design/balance/gameplay in BfA, which causes people to not enjoy it, which causes people to not play it, and then the players that aren't enjoying/playing it voice their disappointment, which causes <em>more</em> people to not play it, and the cycle continues. Before I get into the more direct feedback, I feel it's necessary to explain what <em>exactly</em> the issue is with Protection is. While many people are correct in saying that protection is "weak", many also incorrectly identify <em>why</em> Protection is weak in comparison to other tank specs.</p>
                        <h1 id="sowhatistheactualproblemwithprotectionwarriors">So, what is the <em>actual</em> problem with Protection Warriors?</h1>
                        <p>No, Protection is not undertuned. Protection is not a horribly squishy and awful tank spec. Protection is <em>punishing</em>. And it's "weak" <em>because</em> it's punishing. What do I mean by that? When played correctly and well, the spec is actually quite good and doesn't fall over like many say it does. I'd recommend reading Lala's <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="/protection/protanalysis">Protection Warrior Analysis article</a> as he goes over many of the community perception problems, or rather, the things that people <em>think</em> make Prot weak. Additionally, he provides evidence of the above in that the spec is <em>not</em> weak when played well. Anyway, no one is wrong in calling Protection bad. For difficult content, there is no reason to pick a spec that requires so much effort for it to be good when you can pick a tank spec that's far more forgiving and consistent/safe. For the average player, Protection is weak. Even people who are good at the spec would be better off overall in picking another, safer tank. So I'm not saying that Prot is fine and people just need to get good. No one plays perfectly 100% of the time, and in those moments where you do make a mistake you are more likely to fail as a Prot Warrior. Give this article, <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.peakofserenity.com/2018/10/09/the-fetid-log/">The Fetid Log</a>, a read. It goes over how the difference between a well played Brewmaster and a poorly played Brewmaster isn't that that large. Namely, how well the spec is played doesn't make too much of a difference. It's the opposite for Prot. The difference between playing the spec poorly and playing the spec very well is massive. And this leads into overall tank design which I'll get into in a bit. Point being, that's the main problem with Protection. You are heavily punished for making mistakes, and there are a lot of ways to make mistakes as this spec, and that's a problem.</p>
                        <h2 id="isprotectionviable">Is Protection viable?</h2>
                        <p>This is a question that gets asked a lot, and you'll get a different answer depending on who you ask, because "viable" means one thing to one person and another thing to someone else. To a lot of people, viable = strong. In my opinion, that's the wrong way to define viable. To me, viable means "is it possible and not overly difficulty to do Mythic content with this spec". And the answer to that question with regards to Protection is yes. You can absolutely clear Mythic with it. It's not the best, it's not easy, but it's viable. But of course, <em>just</em> being viable isn't necessarily fun, and it's certainly not fair when there are other tank specs that have a much easier time.</p>
                        <h1 id="tankdesigninbfa">Tank Design in BfA</h1>
                        <p>It was generally understood that one of Blizzard's intentions for tanks going into BfA was to reduce their overall active mitigation uptime, making proper usage of defensives more important. That happened for some tanks and not others. For example, Monks and DKs, the tanks considered to be the "best" right now, both have 100% uptime on their respective "main" active mitigation abilities (Ironskin Brew and Bone Shield). In contrast, Protection Warriors went from having 65-70% Shield Block uptime to 55-60% Shield Block uptime (accounting for Bolster). That's a ~15% reduction to our active mitigation uptime. That's definitely not insignificant. Now, obviously there is a lot more to tank survivability than just active mitigation, but the point still stands. Prot got hit pretty hard in this department. And considering Shield Block's overall importance to our survivability, it's no surprise that this has hindered us.</p>
                        <p>On the note of overall tank design, many in the tanking community are currently unhappy with tank gameplay in BfA. Tank mechanics seem to always be some form of "taunt at 2 stacks", as seen with Brewmasters how well you play your spec doesn't matter all that much, and overall there are just not many ways for a good tank player to differentiate themselves from mediocre tank players. Now, assuming Blizzard sees this as an issue, in my opinion they need to be very careful in the way they go about improving this. I absolutely do not think tanking needs to be made more difficult for the average player. Making something more difficult does not necessarily mean it's more fun or rewarding. In other words, not much needs to be done to the skill <em>floor</em> of tanking, but I think there would be great benefit in increasing the skill ceiling of tanking. There needs to be ways for tanks to "show off". There need to be moments where a tank can do something <em>really</em> cool. That doesn't really happen all that much now. There are many ways to go  about this. You can make tank mechanics more complex/interactive, you can reward better play more, etc. Again, I think there are ways to go about doing those things without hurting the average player. I doubt we'll see sweeping tank changes anytime soon, but I do hope it's something Blizzard is looking at.</p>
                        <h1 id="fixingprotection">Fixing Protection</h1>
                        <p>With all of that said, I think there are two overarching ways Blizzard can improve the Prot Warrior situation. As a reminder, the actual issue with the spec is that it's very punishing of mistakes, and that is in part due to our reliance on our active mitigation, Shield Block. So they can either <strong>a) increase Shield Block uptime</strong>, or <strong>b) increase our survivability outside of Shield Block</strong>. Again, I'm speaking generally here. There are many more things I'd like to see improved. Personally, I'd prefer to see them go down the second route. Sure, you can increase Shield Block uptime, and that would help in a lot of situations, but I don't think it's the best or fun way to go about it.</p>
                        <p>By improving survivability <em>outside</em> of Shield Block, you accomplish a number of things:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Good usage of Shield Block usage is still rewarded.</li>
                        <li>You help out the average player that may not be as good at using Shield Block.</li>
                        <li>Assuming it's done "correctly", you increase survivability against non-blockable damage, which is currently a major pain point for Prot.</li>
                        <li>Overall, Protection would be a far less punishing spec to play.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I'll get into specifics on what I'd like to see done below, but for now I'll focus on the positives/negatives, rather than suggest specific solutions.</p>
                        <h2 id="positives">Positives</h2>
                        <p>Regardless of tuning and the strength of the spec, how much you enjoy Protection is personal preference. Obviously enjoyment for many has to do with how well the spec is doing, but strictly speaking about the rotation itself and how the spec <em>feels</em>, personally I find Protection to be very enjoyable (for the most part). I've enjoyed the "Shield Slam centric" rotation since it was introduced in 7.1.5. Popping Avatar and being able to constantly cast Thunder Clap and deal a lot of damage is really fun. We have high mobility, decent crowd control via Shockwave and Intimidating Shout, raid utility with Rallying Cry, and in terms of class fantasy, I think our kit fits the Protection Warrior style quite well.</p>
                        <p>Anger Management is a core part of the spec in my opinion. I like how often and how many cooldowns we have available to us over the course of a fight. Properly managing that feels really good.</p>
                        <p>Now on the topic of actual survivability and content viability, Protection does an insane amount of AoE damage (perhaps a bit too much). When we have Shield Block up, and when against heavy blockable damage, we fare very, very well.</p>
                        <p><em>Overall</em>, I'm happy with our kit, I'm happy with how the spec plays, and I'm happy with where our strengths like (assuming the spec is made less punishing).</p>
